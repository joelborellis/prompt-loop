what's up everybody happy lunch time um i just wanted to do a quick video because a couple of my polls have finished um and obviously these are super unscientific they're you know people that engage with me on youtube and twitter but i thought they were interesting so poll number one will ai agi or automation permanently dislocate many or most workers within 20 years a third of people said zero to 25 unemployment so it could be that a third of people just say no it's not going to happen a fifth say 25 to 50 unemployment a quarter a full quarter say um 50 to 75 unemployment and then 75 to 100 or uh another fifth the last fifth say 75 to 100 unemployment that's really high i thought this is much more evenly distributed than i thought it would be um so i'm curious to know what people think please uh comment and let me know what you think about agi ai and automation permanently dislocating workers the second set of polls is the same but one is on youtube and the others on twitter so basically what is the future of agi will we lose control will it be autonomous will it kill everyone fortunately in both polls the we will lose control and it will kill everyone was the lowest uh lowest example so people are not afraid of agi anymore which is interesting um however on twitter the highest one was that we would keep control but it would become autonomous and i thought that was an interesting interesting idea because i i personally think that if it's autonomous we lose we lose control and it has to be benevolent but again let me know what you think in the comments um but then on youtube and granted youtube is going to be skewed towards people who are already subscribed to me so they're going to be aware of my work with alignment and so um you know i think i think there's some bias here but 43 of people on youtube said um we will lose control but it will be benevolent so we'll see um anyways thanks for watching just wanted to share some poll results please definitely get engaged in the comments but be nice
