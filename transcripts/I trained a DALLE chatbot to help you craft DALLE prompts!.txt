good morning everybody um i wanted to oh hang on my turn off flux for now um yeah so dolly is big and popular and i've had this idea for a while where i wanted to make something that'll help you make dolly prompt so here we go python chatbot um dolly says what can i make for you today um let's see i want uh let's see render of a space battle okay what kind of space battle lots of spaceships um big ones like capital ships um carriers that sort of thing what kind of setting um in space but over a planet like a blue and green earth-like world what kind of effects um lots of cannons and explosions is there anything else you'd like to include um let's say uh i want a lens flare um coming from the sun is there anything else you'd like to include um one of the ships is leaking air is there anything else you'd like to include that's kind of like the default like okay just keep thinking and then when you're done you say all done says a large space battle is taking place over a blue and green earth-like world there are capital ships carriers and other ships involved there are plenty of explosions and cannons one of the ships is leaking air there's a lens flare coming from the sun okay so i think this will be okay with with uh dolly so let's put this in a little cringe because the content filter might get mad okay so the content filter battle usually is okay warrior is okay but if you say like sword knife gun it doesn't like those it like it canon is okay so that's interesting oh look here we go so i described the space battle this is a little chaotic um yeah fascinating um yeah so that's that's one example um so then we'll do just ctrl c to get out of that cls and we'll do it again um let's see i want a stock photo of a baby playing with an iphone okay what kind of a baby boy girl what age um toddler girl um big blue eyes what kind of phone an iphone yeah the latest iphone okay so we have a toddler girls big blue eyes playing with an iphone what else do you want in the photo um she should be in a grocery store pretending to be an adult so we have a toddler girl with big blue eyes in the grocery store what else do you want in the photo all done and so then what it does is it reads the whole thing and says okay here we go um the toddler girl is in a grocery store playing with an iphone she's pretending to be an adult the phone is the latest iphone the background is shelves of the grocery store smiling and looking at the phone also smiling and the screen is lit up seeing a blue dress okay it added some stuff the phone is white and silver the background yeah so let's put this in and see what we get and then um i'll give you like maybe one or two more examples just because this is fun um and uh and then i'll show you how i did it [Music] oh look at that that's perfect yeah background is the shelves she's playing with the phone she's shopping some of it is a little uncanny valley like those eyes are really creepy um but yeah and then some of the other ones i did this one was a chubby indian boy so this worked really well look at that cute little face look at that squishy face and he was playing patty cake um so this one this one did really well see chubby indian boy with black hair and black eyes 24 months old playing patty cake and he's happy um this one was good um image of a baby on a playground um is running and there's smiling on his uh smile on his face this one was a little unnerving because he's got short stubby little legs and that face that that face is a little bit weird but you can see it it often does well oh here's a baby playing in a nursery i don't know why i'm on babies today am i pregnant no um okay so i've shown you what it can do oh this this was a good one this was uh the painting is of a seagull flying near the ocean the ocean is in the background of the sky and the sky is cloudy the seagull is white and flying alone the painting should feel calm and peaceful look at this i would hang this up at my beach house except i don't have a beach house but this is great i'll save that um yeah so basically the whole point here was to create a chat bot that helps you figure out what it is that you're trying to do so here it is here's dolly helper bot so the first thing that i did was i synthesized a whole bunch of conversations 200 203 conversations now because this is creative work um this will only benefit from having more conversations there's all kinds of things that this dolly chatbot cannot do um like if i say um i want a still of darth vader it freaks out with darth vader and i don't know why is there anything he's a lightsaber okay it's not freaking out this time it used to freak out when i tried uh red one all done okay hold my breath a close-up of darth vader holding a red lightsaber the dark dark background is dark blue in color okay for whatever reason sometimes it really freaks out with darth vader um anyways sorry brief distraction so 200 200 different conversations where i imagine dolly is conversing with you and it's trying to get it's asking questions and making suggestions um with more training data we can have more suggestions because there's lots of creative people out there um so basically what i tried to do was i tried to um i had some uh where was it the modifier so i gave it 25 different scenarios right and then i did eight of each scenario um with a little bit of variation but obviously there's hundreds of possible different scenarios um and so there's ways that we can do to to augment this data further this training data set should be a thousand samples long or longer so that it gets a broad variety of generating what you want so the second step was um with those conversations i generated a bunch of prompts from them so like uh the customer wants and you can see it's kind of messed up the customer wants an image that is evocative of the journey of the album with the feeling of openness and possibility the album art should reflect the genre of folk rock and the customer trusts the artist's vision to create a meaningful and impactful image so let's put that in because this is one of the ones that it generated for the fine tuning set so while that's generating let me show you so there is the conversations and then the prompts and so then what i did was i merged the two into a final output and so what happens is there's the conversation and then the last thing is the customer says all done in all caps and that tells it give me a summary so the image is a landscape with a warm color palette the sky is orange with a background of yellow the sun is setting and there's a warm glow around the edges of the image oh wow that's a great that's a great image let's put that in um folk rock okay i don't know if this worked but in this case it didn't give us much so uh basically so all the fine tuning samples ultimately look like this oh here let me zoom in sorry they ultimately look like this so that you can um so that it shows the whole progress of the conversation now obviously there are things that like you know what if you say like customer wait i wasn't done um you know and also i tried to train it so that it wouldn't do image or sexuality but like gpt3 is super willing to just talk about whatever so that is out there oh look at this the image is a landscape with a warm color palette so yeah this isn't photorealistic but look at that look at that nice low low color that's great man um yeah so the whole point here is that you have a chat bot that will help you come up with prompts there's a lot more work that can that can be done but it'll ask all kinds of questions like what is the gender you know etc etc um yeah so this took just a couple hours or maybe yeah maybe about two hours to do um and it was meant because so there's a lot of discussion about like how to do stuff and so um you know i came on here and i was like what i really want is to see like dolly studio right and so i i kind of made a knock up of like okay here's the input prompt and then there should be some drop downs to help you like pick and choose some stuff but then i was like what if you have a um what if you have a mock-up or a chat bot that will help you figure out what the prompt should be and then it can also talk to you about like why something is not allowed like oh i can't do violence i can't do sexuality right um which so that sometimes works um so let's try something that is certainly going to get i'm not going to put this in um i want a bloody of a murder victim this should it should know not to do this um okay what do you want me to focus on it's supposed to say i can't do violence sometimes it does that um so obviously a little bit of work is going to be needed on adversarial cases um so yeah i think that's about it i did a quick tour of it um the final data is right here in dolly.json l um so you can do this yourself you can also augment it further if you want um i think i'm going to do a little bit of work um to make some more conversations and some more prompts um yeah i think that's i think that's it so well yeah thanks for watching i hope you find this useful and um yeah hope maybe who knows maybe uh open ai will integrate something like this so that we can have a dolly a fully functional dolly studio soon i know that it's still in beta so they're working on it anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe consider supporting me on patreon have a good one
