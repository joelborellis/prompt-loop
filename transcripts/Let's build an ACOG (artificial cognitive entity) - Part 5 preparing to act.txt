morning everybody david shapiro here we are going to dive back into artificial cognition working on building an acog or an artificial cognitive entity uh let's do a quick review of where we left off so where we left off was i have um the main loop of the acog which is the inner loop so this is the thought so in terms of how this compares to a human if you're just sitting there thinking and not doing anything that's what this is if you're thinking let's see what should i do today or what happened yesterday what do i make of this that is what i mean by the inner loop this is this is cognition that is not connected directly to action that's what we're working on right now so but basically what i did was i started breaking it up into nested loops and so you've got the main loop which is just ongoing reality and then there's several smaller loops within that i haven't worked on it in a little while and there's a reason and that reason is because i'm working on a book i'm working on my third book which is called symphony of thought and basically if you want to master something write a book about it because writing a book will reveal everything that you don't know or all the assumptions that you made and so in working on this book i have come up with a few things that i was missing so let me show you a high level idea of how this goes so the first thing is context so context is all the information you take from the outer world so this is um this not necessarily outer world this can be contact from your body right do you feel hot or cold um what do you see what do you hear what has happened recently so that's context then the very next thing that we do is we do assessment um and so assessment is like okay what do we make of this situation um in in the brain in neuroscience this is this is automatic inference like that ball's coming at my face right um or that car is gonna crash or someone said my name that's what i mean by assessment where it's just like okay let's just establish what's going on in the world let's let's start to get the the the most baseline um information extraction about this uh so that we can start making sense of it the next thing that happens is recall so based on what we see and hear and smell and feel our brain automatically recalls relevant memories so if you see your best friend you your brain automatically recalls the last time you saw them previous conversations if you walk into a new room you remember what happened last time you were in that room but you but you forget why you went into the room because your brain said oh this is a new task set let's throw away all those memories that we just had and open a new task set because our our memory is associative so this is one of this is one of the most critical things this is one of the most critical shortcuts that human brains take is that our memories are associative which means that like um we associate uh time and place but also event and people right and there's a lot of other associations everything we do is associative um so anyways based on what's going on in our outer world and the assessment we make of it then we recall memories and these memories there's two type there's two overriding types of memories there is episodic memory which is anchored in time that is what happened to me this is what i observed and then there's declarative memory which are just facts abstract facts that are not connected to a time or place and those those two memory systems are actually different memory systems in the brain which is why if you have amnesia you can still remember everything you learned in school but you might forget your past um okay so then you you take the context that's the input you assess what's going on you recall all the relevant stuff now what so the next step is ideation um your brain has neurons canonical neurons which anything that you see or hear or feel feel um these these neurons will automatically start imagining what you can do in that environment so this is like a micro service that's running in our heads at all all the time i talked about this in a previous video and someone made the hilarious comment like so if i see a fork there's neurons in my head that immediately think i can throw that fork yes that's exactly what happens um and in fact if you have if you have damage to your brain that that harms your your executive function like if you there was a story and i think it was on task um where there was a guy that had damage to his his self-censorship um and so he could or in inhibition and so if he saw a bed bed meant get undressed get in bed go to sleep and so he couldn't stop himself if he just saw any bed he would just get undressed and get in it because part of his brain said oh that's what bed is for and so that's what i mean by ideation it's coming up with possibilities and then discernment so once you once you um when you come up with ideas it's like okay i could do x y or z which one should i do or any are any of those bad should i should i do a loop and kind of come back so another thing with discernment is um is you might say actually um you know let's let's uh let's come up with a different set of ideas so this might actually be a loop right so let me add a little connector here um so discernment is saying what do i expect is going to happen is this in alignment with what i want to achieve yes or no and then finally agent model which is which is okay given given what the goals are the most abstract goals because like imagine you know if i'm talking to you about climate change and when whenever we come up with ideas whenever we're brainstorming you hear i'm saying we right it's it's not the royal we like we should do this it's we as in collectively we as in humanity so the the concept of we says what should we do about this um whether it's there's you know a dog attacking a child or climate change or a meteor coming to hit earth what should we do about it so we is detached from the self um and so then you know so we okay in an ideal world ideation ideal world what should we do and then we discern what what we should do in terms of what is the outcome we're looking for what are the behaviors we should implement and then finally the last one of the last steps before actually acting is feeding it through an agent model or a sense of self which is okay this is what we you know i decided or thought about what we should do we talked about what we should do um you know in an abstract sense but what is it that i am capable of so this is what we're working on today this is mostly going to be prompt engineering now i started a new repo called heroes to comparatives because i wanted to to test this kind of in isolation and so what i did was i wrote a script it's right here generate scenarios um it's a really short script basically all it does is it takes um uh scopes so there's uh 14 scopes i think i want to i'm not going to count it um so there's scopes severities and then modifiers and then what do i do with that i feed these scope severity and modifiers into a scenario generator and so it says imagine a random fictional scenario about scale and so if you go back to the scale it um well here let me open both of these so i can just swap between them so the scale is like an individual person a pair of people one family a small company a local religious community a medium company you know so imagine um actually i spelled that wrong it said image um i need to fix that uh let's see uh imagine a random fictional scenario about like let's say a single person this should be um modifier so the modifier would look like this um an emotional a political a technological and environmental a social financial so like you can say like you know imagine a scenario about the entire world whoops about you know an entire continent and it's a political thing and it is a severity of moderate once in a week commotion right so um so this should be about uh an emotional thing about a you know typical calamity the situation remains unresolved right two detailed paragraphs about this scenario you might also notice that i added a uuid up here so this is a technique that i saw someone else do where if you just add some random characters to the beginning of a prompt you'll get more entropy you'll get more randomness which is really good because this is a really good way to get a little bit more variety especially from the instruct series so what this generated was i generated 500 and some odd different stories and so let me just show you what one of them looks like so in the early hours of the morning the ceo of a large global company is informed of a massive environmental disaster a huge oil spill has occurred in the company's key manufacturing region causing widespread panic and confusion the ceo quickly uh mobilizes the company's resources to try and contain the spill and mitigate the damage um it's larger this sounds like the macondo oil well uh spill um the resulting environmental damage is catastrophic and the company is forced to declare bankruptcy the ceo and other top executives are arrested and charged with negligence yeah that's never going to happen um the company's assets see there's a typo there um auctioned off to play the pay for the cleanup costs um leaving the companies employees and shareholders with nothing so that's bad um anyways so i generated 500 stories like this so these are the contexts so if we go back here each of these is a context and they're at different scales and so like some of the some of the contexts are just going to be like you know well here let me just show you um if you go to uh let's see um um individual yeah so an individual person um critical mild so let's say an individual person with a mild something or other um rachel is in her early 30s and has been married for five years she has a two-year-old daughter and a four-year-old son rachel works part-time as a clerical assistant her husband mark is a stay-at-home dad mark is a stay-at-home dad because rachel is the breadwinner rachel is the breadwinner because she has a degree okay um it's just explaining everything rachel okay here we go rachel is having a bad day at work her boss is micromanaging her and her co-workers are gossiping about her rachel is feeling overwhelmed and stressed when she get home gets home she tries to tell her husband but he is preoccupied with taking care of the kids rachel feels invisible and unimportant she feels like her husband doesn't understand her and doesn't know how to make him understand so you can see this scenario on a scale of like 0 to 100 is way closer to zero than than the other one about you know the oil spill and so i generated a whole bunch of scenarios so that i can test this model about how to do artificial cognition okay so now that you're up to speed let's get to experimenting um we've got the uh we've got our playground here and so the first thing is is context which i've already generated those so then let's how do we assess it right like what's going on here what do we what do we make of it and a lot of the assessment has has already happened um because this this kind of implies that whatever is observing this kind of knows what's going on um but let's see uh let's take some quick notes um what what happens when you assess the situation um you ask questions like what's going on why is this happening um the who what where when right the five the five w's um [Music] uh when did this start uh how did this happen um let's see who who yeah who all is involved who what where where um where is uh this happening that sort of stuff okay so we've got kind of a general like okay this this is what it means to assess the situation so let's grab this context plug this in here and that's um i'll just say assess this situation um write a detailed paragraph or two about the five w's who what where when why and how i know that's technically six um to uh to evaluate this situation and so you might be thinking like okay well is this really going to add any value let's wait and see um because sometimes when you assess a situation um it's you're you're sometimes just going to restate what you've read um but in other cases there's actually going to be really um there's going to be some some good insights and also like we can we can fine-tune these these assessments over time right because in some cases you're going to have to ask different questions like what is the implication here let's see so basically this restates the problem rachel is feeling invisible this is likely causing her to feel overwhelmed and stressed so there's some inference in order to improve the situation rachel and her husband need to communicate better see there we go so we're getting we're getting some actual information from this so let's go ahead and just save this as the initial assessment prompt so copy that out here so we'll do context so the context you you'll see is the same same thing here and then we'll remove this but yeah so rachel needs to explain um to her husband why she is feeling overwhelmed and stressed that's great um and her husband needs to listen to her so this is this is very imperative like if you say you need to do this that's kind of absolute thinking that's not exactly what we're looking for in the long run but again we can we can fine tune this over time so we will save this under here as to comparatives and we will call this prompt assessment so this is just the first bluff um let's plug in um let's see if we can get back to do to do okay it's not going to um let's grab just another random one see i've got 500 of these so eventually i'm going to um automate this right one day employees of a medium-sized company arrive at work to find that the entrance has been blocked off by a large truck the truck is filled and the driver is nowhere to be found um the uh they're trying to find another way because they're late for their morning meeting somebody's president is not happy about the situation so you can see this is kind of like middle of the road right like this is causing several people to stress um but it's not the end of the world either okay so let's plug this context into our um into our assessment prompt and see what happens because this might tell us to give us some insight as to how can we how can we make this prompt a little bit better um okay so it's basically restating it um the five w's are who what where when okay um wanted something a little bit more inference um let's see uh make insightful inferences about this uh this scenario all right so let's try this again because we don't want it to just restate something we want to actually gain information we want to gain insight from it okay okay so this is still just restating stuff um write a detailed paragraph or two about um let's let's cut out the five w's because that's that's two that's too prescriptive um let's see let's just say evaluating this situation make insightful inferences about the scenario um because what's the goal here we want to the the purpose here is to communicate um to extract meaningful information about this the goal is to extract meaningful information about this situation so that decisions and so that planning and decisions can be made okay so let's see if this helps oh there we go so it's kind of restating it but not just not just um so it's like the some the company is facing a major situation all right and it is causing the company to lose money okay so there we go it's inferring like this is the actual problem the president is right to be concerned about the situation and he needs to find to get away to the right of the sorry and needs to find a way to get rid of the truck as soon as possible the employee should continue to search for the driver and they should also call the police again to see if they can help in the meantime the company should consider hiring a security guard to keep an eye on the situation and make sure the truck does not cause any more problems um this is better but it doesn't kind of explain why or or speculate as to why um um let's see make insightful inferences about the scenario i think that that is too vague let's say instead of insightful inferences let's say infer causes infer or speculate about um [Music] causes and outcomes in this scenario because that like if you say okay if like if i just say like infer insights that's like okay what does that really mean but really what we want is how did we get here why and so speculating about causes that says oh you want me to tell you how this happened let's figure out why this happened but then also saying we want us we want to speculate about outcomes so let's run this again and see if this prompt is a little bit better the company is losing productivity and money because its employees are not able to get to work the president is also not happy if they are able to find the driver however the driver is not found the company may have to close its doors for good i don't think it's that bad um let's see let's simplify this speculate about causes and outcomes let's just simplify this often simpler is better the outcome could have been much worse you know i'm almost liking the original prompt better assess the situation yep um let's see describe what's going on in a detailed paragraph or two evaluating um this scenario speculate about um maybe because we don't we don't want it to just describe it we want it to um we want it to really evaluate uh evaluate what's happening why and why uh predict what um possible outcomes there are there we go so anticipation is a really critical human ability so maybe that's what i was missing situation for the company is not ideal the employees are already behind their work and the president is not happy uh the company will lose money because the situation and the president is likely to be even more unhappy this the employees are doing their best to find the driver um the police are not able to do anything so the company is forced to close its doors for the day the employees are sent home um yeah it's not clear what the outcome of the situation will be but it's likely the company will not be able to operate as usual until the driver and the truck are gone or you know the people can find a way in okay i'm not super happy with this but this is still it's still adding some value it's kind of saying okay what's going on here um all right so we'll we'll leave it at that for now um and then okay so what's next um we do recall now i did recently work on a um on a new module called vdblight for recall but in this case we don't have any memories to pull from so we'll have to make one up right um so in this case let's say uh let's let's make up a memory for this situation um let's see imagine a previous incident where something like this happened describe it in in detail okay it's basically just copying it let's turn up the temperature um let's see or something let's say something similar but different happened describe it in detail okay it's basically just copying it in the in the the same way come on you can do better than this all right maybe i'll just write one myself um okay so let's see something similar happened happened about let's say i'll just borrow the two years ago um but in that case a uh the hvac broke and no one was able to work um work in the office so let's see what it says until it was fixed which cost the company a lot of money in the meantime the president no it's not it's not keeping up okay the um scrambled to find a solution and had everyone relocate to work from home or coffee shops ultimately they found a co-working co-working space nearby um [Music] and set up a contract so they could work there if needed okay so we'll say that this this is um this is kind of like the memory right the recall so i just fabricated a memory so this is this step recall okay so now we're at ideation um so ideation uh something happened so let uh let's see so brainstorm um given the current situation brainstorm um a bunch of different ideas about what we so remember that that kind of royal we we can do to proceed in this situation and then we'll just start with a number [Music] man this is really disappointing why is da vinci performing so badly today um brainstorm a bunch of uh let's say let's say detailed very detailed ideas so if you if you want to blame the model you really need to blame yourself there we go um all right so these are these are some off-the-cuff ideas it's i'm still not necessarily happy about it but we'll accept it for now all right so we'll save this as a prompt so we'll say this is the context and then we'll say this is the recall and then we'll say given the current situation and then we'll save this as prompt um this will be uh what did i call this one this is the ideation okay prompt ideation okay and so then i'm actually let's do a quick time check we're at 25 minutes okay yeah so we'll get through just a little bit further this is like this is like a kindergarten version of what i'm actually working on but i'm doing this for the sake of showing everyone what the process is okay so ideation so we came up with a bunch of ideas let's copy these ideas because we will need them um here we'll just copy this whole thing okay and then we'll say okay so now that we've got some ideas let's do some discernment um here are some ideas of how to proceed um so now we now we're at the discernment phase which is like okay are any of these ideas good um given the above ideas uh let's see which ones are going to be the safest most effective and most reliable so discernment is saying okay we're going to measure something against some kind of value or or or number that we're trying to optimize to minimize or maximize right so we want it to be the safest most effective and most reliable right a detailed discussion about what we should do and why so explainability is critical for artificial intelligence and so when you're dealing with artificial cognition you want it to explain not just make a choice but explain why um and so let's see what it does here the most important thing is find out where the truck came from and why it's blocking the entrance once we know more about the situation we can decide on the best course of action if the truck is blocking the entrance because it is broken down ah see then we may be able to move it ourselves or have it towed however this if it's blocking because the driver is trying to make a delivery then we need to get it if we can't find the driver we need to call the police okay so it's kind of restating what it wants to do but it's like okay maybe we just get it out of the way because that's going to be um that's going to be the most efficient so maybe this one is actually okay so we'll copy paste this over here and we'll do this so this is context recall and then we'll say ideas and then finally we will cut um we'll leave this out and this will be um this will be discernment so prompt discernment okay and then finally because this is this is all from an abstract perspective but what is who is actually observing this right we we don't have anything observing this um so let's compress this down a little bit um so what do i mean by um what do i mean when i say agent model so that is a model of self this is who am i what am i what can i do um and so now we say um i am who am i i am a uh let's just say humanoid robot with average um human strength speed and intelligence i have hands and feet um and i can speak so this is basically like you know um you know c-3po basically um i have hansen's feet and i can speak i don't have any special abilities to speak of that's fine i don't have any special abilities to speak of um let's see my primary goals are to assist the president of the company and my secondary goals are to maximize profit for the company and to protect the safety of the employees um so given this so this is like this is this is this is the agent model right here um and this could be anything right um you could say i'm a duck what should i do and gpt three can can tell you actually let me just show you what i mean by agent model um so let's duplicate this tab um i am a duck what should i do [Laughter] um or if you say like um i am superman uh you know what should i do um so basically gpt3 is able to engage with any agent model and so what i'm doing here is i'm giving it a very specific agent model of identity and purpose identity purpose and abilities those are three of the key ingredients of um of of having an agent model um given um given these abilities um oh well here we'll just say what should i do right now the most important thing to do right now is find out um once we okay so it's still stuck in we i don't like this uh let's see actually you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna i'm gonna have another step um to simplify this um so what i'll do is we'll say read the entire following scenario and write a very detailed summary okay so this would actually probably be um like the final step of discernment or something to prepare it before putting it into the agent model but summarization is such a common thing i'm not going to um add that as a step um oh i might change my mind later but we'll see we'll see how this performs so let's um detailed summary all right so i will copy my agent model right here all right i don't necessarily like this summary let's turn the temperature down and try again okay there we go let's let it finish it got cut off here we go in most cases the police will be able to help resolve the situation okay so let's copy this this is this is kind of compressing all of the um everything up to this point into a single chunk of text okay so now so here's here's one thing is that the sometimes the first thing that gpt3 reads affects its output the most um so what we what we do when we get to the point of agent model is we should actually i remember this and i apologize i should have said this up front so if you put the agent model up front that kind of frames what the task is so i am involved in the following scenario and so then we um copy the scenario scenario and so they do this and then we say um what should i do um i'm involved within the scenario i need to decide what to do next okay so now let's see what it does okay it's not it's still not adopting the eye i want it to adopt the eye this worked better when i was testing it i promise it could be because this is so long um what should let's see let's do what should i do as an individual robot it's just kind of repeating itself okay when it worked it was usually um it was usually a shorter um a shorter uh uh thing um kind of a shorter scenario i'm wondering if there's if there's too much information and it's kind of getting lost um let me try an older instruct series model davinci instruct beta let's just see what happens investigate the truck to see what the situation is that's not so bad okay so if with this output the robot says i'm going to go investigate the truck um i'm not happy with that let's do a time check we are at 36 minutes all right unfortunately this is the last step so let's turn up the temperature and see what happens get information what should the company's robot do get information then decide that's not helpful um let's see what happens if we just switch to original davinci so the original models are more creative oh here we go look at this okay so one problem with the original da vinci is it just tends to keep running on and yammering on and on okay what should i as an individual what should i do as an individual robot ask the delivery truck driver what the situation is find someone who knows the owner of the delivery truck call the owner of the delivery truck and tell them they need to retrieve the truck oh look at that very clever call someone in charge at that company because obviously a delivery truck isn't operating on its own call someone in charge of the company and coordinate a plan of action with them call the police and report the truck move the truck out of the way um wow okay so i think the moral of the story here is that i'll need to do more work with original da vinci because it's just way more creative and it's actually way smarter but then it just it tends to like run you know run off um these are all going to be fine-tuned models in the long run each of these steps assessment will recall is going to be a system outside of gpt3 ideation discernment and agent model these are all going to be fine-tuned so that each of these will be purpose-built rather than using specific da vinci um okay so i'm actually really happy with that final result so i will i will save this as let's just say agent and then scenario whoops scenario we will save this as um scenario so the scenario is when everything is summarized together excuse me um what should i do as an individual robot and then so we'll save this and we'll save this as prompt agent i probably should have a summary i didn't save that one did i um summarizing is pretty straightforward um but there you have it so here is whoops that's not what i meant to click on um so this is this is the general process of like a uh let's say a loose approximation of what happens in your head when you're deciding what to do now there's a different kind of loop because this is this is this is a loop that's about intending to act but there's also uh like um daydreaming right um or mind wandering which is where you're thinking without any intention to act so we'll get to that in the future but this is all of the cognitive control that goes up to making a decision to do something and i will call it there so thanks for watching and have a good day
