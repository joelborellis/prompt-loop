morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video we're about to start a brand new series about uh AI startup crash course but before we get started I wanted to call your attention to my patreon page uh as you might have noticed my videos do not have any ads I I tried ads briefly and I hated it and so did everyone else um and so ad free forever but if you find my content valuable please consider supporting me on patreon uh presently my goal is to get to the point where I can do this full time I still have a day job and I also have a stealth startup that I'm trying to get going so every little bit helps alright enough of that let's Jump Right In so today's episode is AI startup crash course episode one your Founders team so your people problem is your absolute biggest problem this is true for Founders and this is true for hiring in general so first I'll recommend the book who by Jeff smart and Randy Street this book is invaluable in terms of in terms of you know as it promises solve your number one problem um there are a lot of good Concepts in this book but the the concept that I found absolutely most helpful is especially when you want someone with leadership potential is you want to look for someone with a probing mind you wanna you wanna look for someone who is curious who asks questions who wants to deconstruct things and understand who what where how when and why those are the absolute best kinds of people to look for okay so why are we starting with the founder team uh well the founder team is the number one reason that startups fail it's not because you had a bad idea it's not because the technology it's not anything else it's because of people now as a member of the founder team you might be part of the problem someone else might be part of the problem it's never like you or me or one person it's the team and so what I mean by this is that uh the wrong team or the wrong you know even if it's the right team but you've got one wrong member you might be the wrong member um that's the reason that it'll fail uh you fail to learn you fail to adapt you you failed to find knowledge you failed to think right whatever it's you know you can you can externalize it you can internalize it you can make excuses but at the end of the day it's the people so finding the right team or building the right team is absolutely critical now your role in that is to be the right team member and we'll talk a little bit about those details later but first like it starts with you it starts within um and so you got to make sure that you are as prepared as possible for the AI startup Adventure okay so building a team versus joining a team or finding a team what's the difference there really isn't any difference because uh until a team is formed it's just a collection of people right if you have three out of four Founders the Dynamics are gonna change when the first when the fourth person joins regardless of what the dynamic was before so building and joining is the same thing whether you're a team of one and you're looking to join a larger group or you're a team of three you know two or three or four looking for you know your third fourth or fifth member it's the same it's the same exact thing because you're trying to find each other out there in The Ether so where do you look who do you talk to well the number one place to start is look in your existing Network if you ask people whether it's people you know IRL or people you know on the internet uh there are all kinds of ways to network and more often than not if you have if you are very targeted um and you say I want to meet someone who does X um humans we humans are uh like compulsively helpful especially if you ask like hey you I know that you're well connected you know you ask one person please give me connection or connect me to who you who you think you know um people are very willing to do that uh so network network network and that'll actually be the subject of one of our future videos um on this topic is networking specifically uh but yeah so you network there's also accelerators so if you're crazy enough to be a startup founder um you can go join y combinator or any number of other accelerator programs out there I happen to know specifically that y combinator has a co-founder matching service now I don't need that service because I already have a team I'm already part of a team um but it's out there so but the number one thing is you got to put yourself out there you've got to advertise that that's what you're looking for I don't mean advertise like don't spend AdSense Revenue um but you have to put it out on your Twitter LinkedIn YouTube whatever social media you use uh Facebook Tick Tock whatever you just say this is what I'm doing this is what I'm looking for and in point of fact it's what I'm doing on my YouTube video I'm not looking for a Founder we will be hiring more though so um also we'll be looking for uh investors so if you're interested reach out to me on LinkedIn get in touch all right team size and composition how big should your team of Founders be hang on I need some coffee your founder team should be three to five people now um I don't know all the reasons for this but everyone says it that just seems to be the sweet spot and in my own experience my team uh you know is me and three other people and uh that seems really good to me we are looking for a potential number five we think we found them um but you know uh in in terms of in terms of core people these need to be like your pillars right these need to be your rock solid people that are fully committed um and and and have no second second guesses uh I I don't remember why I heard this but someone said uh you know being a co-founder is like being in codependent marriage and this is not a compliment um that if you're familiar with codependence um it's basically where you are emotionally dependent on someone for very unhealthy reasons um and you can't get away from them so that's how bad it can get so you need to make sure that everyone on your team gets along you can handle stress you can handle conflict and you can handle disagreement how do you find people that can handle those generally you look for their temperament their disposition and other aspects about their life um you know if someone is well we could get super Lost In The Weeds I've put it out there this this is something you need to look out for you'll learn as you go um at a minimum for an AI startup you need at least three three of these kinds of skills and ideally everyone wears multiple hats you need a tech person at least one we have two so someone who can build your apps do the AI do the prompt engineering again we have two we've got myself I'm the AI expert on the team and then we've got a CTO who's going to be responsible for engineering and software um second you need a business person ideally this is someone who has who has either run a company or done startups before there are plenty of people out there uh previous Founders and co-founders that are looking to build new teams so if you just if you look for someone who is you know uh has founder or co-founder beside their name on LinkedIn or Twitter message them because you never know even if they are not um hiring they probably know someone who does through networking or the network effect um so and and this business person is going to be critical because there's so many ins and outs to building and running a business that you don't think of so if you if you found my channel it's probably because you wanted to learn how to do AI um and if you're if you're an expert at it great but honestly learning AI or mastering you know large language models in gpd3 that's like 10 of the whole thing and that's one of the reasons I actually decided to put all of my code and videos back online is because okay coming up with a neat toy you know through through python scripting and gpt3 uh the playground like that's 10 of the battle there is so much more you need to do um so you know I I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be able to hurt anybody just by putting some of my code and videos back up um then you also need a marketing or product person you absolutely need someone who understands market and product um this is this is a non-negotiable uh and and you know don't take my word for it um if you do if you do your homework you talk to uh startup accelerators and coaches and mentors they will tell you that you know ninety percent of startups fail and of those you know the vast majority of them fail because they had the wrong team and they didn't get this far but the team that you know the the the teams that do you know stick it out and that they do build a product and still fail ninety percent of those fail because they couldn't get product Market fit you need someone who understands uh marketing and product so that's at a bare minimum and as I mentioned already you need to wear multiple hats I do all three of these um I think I'm uh and uh you know pretty much everyone on on my team wears at least two hats um so yeah this is the kind these are this is the kind of team that you need to build uh we talked about where to look um and so okay what's what what comes after that uh well obviously you're not gonna have a full c-suite you know you're not going to have a chief uh finance officer and a cheap legal office or chief legal officer don't hire a cheap legal officer Chief legal officer I apologize you will have to hire outside help um so here are the three kinds of groups of people that I have found that I needed so far so first you'll need a legal team fortunately there are many attorneys out there in the world um you'll need to find a good corporate lawyer who's familiar with startups um this will answer so many of your questions um it's also very expensive you're looking at like bare minimum three thousand dollars for a decent attorney to uh to draft the Articles of Incorporation and file them for you um so the legal team uh how do you find a good lawyer ask for references um talk to the talk to the most excellent people that you know and say reference uh refer me to a lawyer and chances are the first lawyer that you talk to won't be able to help you but lawyers know other lawyers so you say hey this is what I'm doing can you can you recommend someone and that's how we found like a chain of three lawyers of references and I am super satisfied with uh the attorney that that we hired um you'll also need a finance team the point of of building a startup is to make money therefore you need someone to handle money it's just that simple um whether this is someone who is a CPA who can who can uh you can hire on an as needed basis or someone who can who is familiar with handling payroll and taxes and accounts receivable and billing and all that stuff um on your team or a uh or a managed service you will need this um and you'll need it sooner rather than later also one thing that I forgot to put on this slide is you're going to be asking for venture capital or investment ideally your Finance person understands that too because uh investment is a whole different ball game now fortunately in my case my attorney is also a CPA so he understands all the regulatory requirements and all the documentation that goes into um into uh getting investment and and making sure that your your paperwork is in order so that venture capital or other investors aren't spooked so in my case I'm lucky that I got a two for one um he doesn't offer the the taxes and Payroll Services but he is certified so he knows what we need and can refer us and lastly you need mentors and advisor um mentors and advisors sorry the problem is You Don't Know Jack and uh so you need to find people who do who are willing to teach you mentors and advisors are critical and indispensable because you know there's things that you're that you're an expert at like you know I'm an expert at uh at at Python and and Ai and maybe a handful of other things but there's a whole lot of stuff that I'm not an expert in such as you know medicine and law and and and um you know scientific Publications and everything else that I'm trying to build AI tools for so and there's I'm also not an expert in startups I'm not an expert in business I'm not an expert in hiring I'm not an expert in anything but by networking and putting myself out there and helping people for free with my YouTube channel there's lots of people that are willing to help me in return and so mentors and advisors they will fill in your gaps and they will prevent you from making really brain dead stupid mistakes they will tell you what you don't know because by definition you have blind spots I have blind spots guess who can see your blind spots other people specifically people more experienced than you so these are three groups of people that you will need to talk to Who you gonna call not the Ghostbusters there's no ghosts it is spooky um doing a startup is very confusing and uh very overwhelming but these are three groups of people that you'll need sooner rather than later by the way Okay so this episode is about your founder team there's some stuff that's harder to nail down in terms of what you need in your founder team so I call these the intangibles stuff like chemistry and beliefs your team Dynamic is a hundred percent necessary to get it right it's a Vibe it's a feeling it's a flow um personality and communication style conflicts will uh will destroy your team absolutely um I have walked away from more than a dozen different teams and Ventures over the last two years for various reasons I'm not gonna I'm not gonna air any dirty laundry that's not fair to myself or others um but it's not a good fit right it could be the perfect team but they're not right for me I'm not right for them um or you know in some cases uh you don't have the same vision right you might have you might have the right capabilities but your beliefs are wrong or or maybe you come to the conclusion that you come you come to believe that the team that you're on isn't capable they're not going to pass muster whatever it is there's all kinds of reasons that things can go wrong and uh the the dynamic that chemistry you know when it's good and you know when it's not um one thing that that uh that that I am glad that I did is I walked away and I failed fast so failing fast means cutting bait and running when things aren't working so if you don't have that chemistry if you don't have uh if you don't have that that Vibe where everything is just it's easy it all I'm not going to say it feels effortless but there is there is like a sort of flow state that happens when you have the right team so if you don't have that or if there's conflicts early just walk away Don't Force It um so for that I recommend this book The Power of a positive no um this book is about boundaries uh it's also about negotiation this book is critical it will change your entire life but as a founder or a co-founder you're going to have a lot of people who want your time attention and money especially money the ability to say no diplomatically is absolutely imperative um the so this is this is a very constructive way of negotiating so rather than just saying like no screw off you say yes to yourself you say no to something that is unreasonable and then they say yes to an alternative or a compromise um so yeah I say walk away fail fast as I mentioned I've walked away for more than a dozen different teams groups and Ventures over the years uh and I'm glad that I did it was the right thing to do and sometimes it was a adventure of a few minutes in other cases it was a venture of a few weeks or a venture of a few months um walking away is like you have to get good at that because your first you know your your first rodeo you're gonna fall off a few times now one thing that I want to point out is that if there's a lot of friction and resentment and anger and tension building up walking away will feel good right you'll be like oh man I just don't want to deal with this person anymore my life will be better if I don't have to see this person and talk to them ever again in that case it's really easy to walk away if you if you do a gut check and you say will my life be easier without this person yes or no and you say oh man if you if your heart like feels lighter at the thought of not having to deal with someone anymore you know that it's probably time to walk away now what's harder than that is when you don't want to walk away from someone because you like them but it's still not working out this was the hardest thing that I have ever had to do so far is is to use this this model of the of a positive no to tell someone look it's not working out and it's not this is not what I want but we have to be fair to everyone involved to the team to you so on and so forth and the way the so one this book but two the uh the way that I handled it so well was because I had mentors and advisors I called two of my most trusted people when I had to fire someone that I liked and uh they talked me through it and I did it and it was good so I I can't recommend this book enough but also mentors and advisors um and fail fast there's nothing wrong with it nothing wrong with failing fast and finally I mentioned at the beginning that if you um are you're you're a human therefore you're fallible and you are probably part of the problem that's okay you can learn um and that's why I've recommended three books in this first lesson so consensus is my personal secret weapon consensus overcomes so many problems um and it is the best communication framework as far as I can tell for a team of co-founders so what I when I say consensus I mean Capital C consensus this is a formalized communication free framework um there is a there is a there's a a slow formal process for big difficult decisions but there's a lot of lessons from this uh from this particular book and from consensus training that you can apply to every single meeting and as the uh as the subcaption promises you achieve very high commitment decisions which is exactly what you need if you're in a startup but I will also say that consensus will impact every aspect of your life it has helped in my my day job it has helped immeasurably with my startups um and my current stealth startup in particular it's all it also helps in your relationships because understanding a model of let's get what everyone wants and needs out on the table and talk through it and find the best solution that is just a very particular way of thinking about dealing with people and so consensus actually prevents a lot of conflict another thing that it does is I got a text from uh from one of the co-founders um he so when I joined the team one of the things that they said is that they believed in consensus and what they meant by that was lower C consensus just the idea of consensus so I came in and I taught the team Capital C consensus and so he texted me he's like I really appreciate consensus because like how did he say it like there's no fear or there's no ego and it's both because when a team of four people all collaboratively comes up with a decision and a solution it doesn't belong to any one person and everyone feels better about it knowing that they're only 25 percent of the commitment and that everyone else believes in it wholeheartedly that is so critical because then if something goes wrong it's Collective ownership not individual ownership not like this was your idea and I told you blah blah like you know even if you're mature enough not to say that you might still feel it but with consensus that goes away and so another part of consensus is anyone can raise a concern at any time and say you know I'm not comfortable with this let's find a better way and invariably when you identify those those vulnerabilities and you find a better way the solution you come up with is also much better and everyone is like wow I could not have come up with that Solution on my own um and and it's that's the entire point and that's how you get those High commitment decisions uh is through consensus so there you have it this is episode one of uh the AI startup crash course your Founders team thanks for watching consider supporting me on patreon and uh yeah let's get busy
