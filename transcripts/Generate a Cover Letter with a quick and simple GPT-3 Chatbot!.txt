hey everyone david shapiro here for a quick video today i had someone message me i think it was on twitter or linkedin asking if i could help with a cover letter generator and i was like no i don't really do consulting anymore um but then i was looking through my video history and i saw that my email generator was very popular and so the email generator you can go go look at the code or look at the video but the email generator is pretty straightforward it just takes a blob of text and writes an email um if it can take a chat log and convert it into an email it can take a rant and turn it into an email so on and so forth so uh let's just this i and i wanted to try this i was thinking like okay that was a popular video resumes cover letters nobody knows how to write a cover letter right you don't ever do it um and i thought like at first i was like is this unethical because like a cover letter is supposed to be written by you to you know but i was like no like you people go to career coaches people have mentors actually um my fiance has a a friend who is like a professional um like career coach who helps with cover letters i ha i have another friend who who actually gave me advice for my resume so i was like no like it's just another tool um so i don't think there's anything unethical about using a machine to help you generate this thing um so yeah here we go the prompt that i wrote and this was my first attempt i didn't make any changes so the following is a conversation between a career coach and a job seeker the career coach asks the job seeker lots of questions to learn about them so they can write an awesome cover letter so it just says this is what's going on this is the goal the career coach also asks about the company and job they want as well as their work history strengths and passions finally once the coach has enough information they write an impressive cover letter so all i started was here was hey there what's your name and so this was actually an actual generation i posted it on twitter because i was like well that was easy my name is dave hi dave tell me a little bit about the company and job you're interested in and since i grew up watching wiley coyote and roadrunner i said acme dynamite i want to work at acme dynamite as a product specialist i love blowing stuff up that sounds like a really fun job what are some of your strengths i freaking love dynamite i know everything there is to know about it did you know that the largest non-nuclear explosion ever created was an underwater demolition project no i didn't know that that's really interesting what is your work history like well i used to be an ordinance tech with the us army none of this is true actually about me that's great what did you do in that role mostly i said demo charges to dispose of failed ordnance and demo and or demolished structures that sounds like a really exciting job i'm sure you have lots of experience with dynamite what are you passionate about dynamite i can tell while i think i have enough information and so then um it ended there and i i added this cover letter so that just tells the tells the machine okay time to write the cover letter and this is what it wrote to whom it may concern i am writing in regards to the open product specialist position at acme dynamite i'm immensely excited about the prospect of working for such a fun and innovative company i bring with me a wealth of experience with dynamite both in my previous role as an ordinance tech with the us army and my personal life i am passionate about dynamite and i firmly believe that i have the skills and knowledge to excel in this role now this is kind of generic kind of boilerplate so you could probably do some fine tuning to make a little bit more robust of a of a cover letter but you know what like for just off the cuff just some prompt engineering i'm really impressed with this in addition to my experience with dynamite i am also highly motivated and detailed oriented to individual i'm confident that i can be an asset to the acme dynamite team and i look forward to contributing to your success thank you for your consideration i look forward to hearing from you soon all right so let's do this again um so let's just like seeker um hi there what's your name while e coyote coach oh and so now stop that's not what you're supposed to do why didn't it work this time okay so i forgot to point out um uh coach and seeker so by having um here my name is we'll do period um if you i add the stop sequences because otherwise it kind of will will just go off and run like it like you just saw it um nice to meet you wiley uh what company are you looking to work for um i want to work for the um eat the road runner foundation coach okay great what job are you looking for um seeker i want to eat i'm definitely aging myself i see well what are your strengths um seeker i'm very hungry unmotivated to catch the roadrunner um [Music] i excel at designing and setting traps such as by using rockets cages and automated mallets coach those are great strengths what are you passionate about road runner flesh i'm having way too much fun with this coach okay i think i have enough information to write an impressive cover letter okay cover letter let's see what he writes to whom it may concern the roadrunner eater i am confident that i am the perfect candidate for this job as i have a great deal of experience in hunting and trapping roadrunners my strengths include my hunger and motivation as well as my creativity and designing traps i'm passionate about eating road runners and i'm confident that i can be an asset to your organization thank you for your time and consideration wild e coyote okay so this clearly works let me do a time check i don't think i'm going to yeah this is only six minutes um i don't think i'm going to do this as a fine tuning project uh honestly i just did this because i'm waiting for other fine tuning jobs to finish um but i think this this worked rather well so i'll just save this as another demo um demo two so this will this will be up in the uh the github repo um so that you can check these these prompts if you want so it'll be under cover letter generator i might revisit it and do um do this as a fine tuning job but uh so here's here's the advantage here's the chief advantage of this is that by having a prompt by having this prompt it kind of gives you the structure because as a normal job seeker like you might not know what to include but by having this prompt it will walk you through the process and so i'm sure someone with uh with a little bit of web experience could probably build this into a quick ue ui um and then you could probably even do a second prompt to make actually no let's do that okay yeah yeah yeah all right so given um all right i think i already copied this out yeah okay so given the following chat log write um an impressive cover letter uh let's see the cover letter should um the coach cover letter um let's see the cover letter should be bold impactful um and professional um include um include details such as strengths and passions um but also address the company directly so what i did here uh let me actually show you i did i did a little bit of research so there's um some of these ideas i got from like harvard business review like how to write a cover letter think about the future strong opening um emphasize your personal value and it kind of already knows all this i actually i wouldn't be surprised if gpt3 already has read these articles especially the older ones um so yeah and then there's you can look at examples you know so on and so forth um yeah so anyways let's just take this and plug this into the playground let's see if it gives me anything just a little bit different tomb it may concern um let's see it's a little bit better yeah okay let's run this again so i'm writing in regards to the open position based on the requirements as uh as someone with an extensive background in hunting and trapping yeah so this is a little bit more a little bit more professional so it might be might be beneficial to split it up into multiple problems that fat fingered that real hard [Laughter] okay uh and it looks like it'll generate a similar format okay cool so i will yeah there you go so i'll save this as the um so this will be this will be a cover of prompt cover letter and then what i'll do is i'll come in here and rename um so we've got prompt for the cover letter and then we'll have prompt for the um prompt for the uh coach chat and then i guess i don't need i'll just leave the demo up there as an example but yeah okay so you can see basically splitting it into two will have oh sorry let me zoom in a little um we'll have one prompt for handling the cover letter and a second prompt or the first prompt will be to generate the chat and then another prompt to actually generate the cover letter um and so then if you want to play with this you can let me go ahead and cd cover letter get status get add git commit am all done and get push whoops push okay so you can you can play with this yourself if someone um does build this into a ui please send it to me and i will feature you on my channel or twitter or whatever but i think that i think that this you just build a basic website that does this and you've got instant value alright well thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon
