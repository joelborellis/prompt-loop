good morning everybody david shapiro here with another video so for some background let's set the stage a couple days ago i made a video about is asking if lambda and gbt3 are sentient um i said no but and it was just a quick video it was just a comment on um this this article by blake lemoine um who came to the conclusion that lambda was sentient and that it needed rights etc etc much ado on the internet um this is this is the page for lambda so basically lambda is a lot a collection of of um apis uh search engines um large language models it's it's a bunch of things um it is a very complex system uh and it has long-term memory which can give the illusion that it is sentient it can model human conversations which basically allows it to tell it can tell you what you want to hear it can model any conversation so i had a conversation with um a good a a new and good friend from my sci-fi writing group who is in the same exact vein that i am he researches um things like artificial intelligence alignment reinforcement learning he's also trained in philosophy and physics so basically what i'm going to do today is we're going to take a much deeper dive into the concept of machine intelligence and machine consciousness and machine sentence but in order to do that we first have to talk about our consciousness sentience and intelligence so i've got here a stack of books to talk about this so basically i'm just kind of walking you through what i know and what i believe and why so where to start i think we'll start with post-modernism and nihilism nihilism post-modernism is a reaction to modernism which one of the things that modernism said was that there must be a correct answer for everything and that there must be a knowable truth to everything modernism arose after the enlightenment where and transcendentalism and so modernism emerged in the west as an intellectual and artistic movement but then post-modernism came about in the 60s in paris france because the thinkers and artists and everyone realized wait there is actually no such thing as a universal truth because what's true in america is not true here and it's certainly not true across the world things about like gender and sexuality that's one of the biggest things that they pointed out is like wait you know the truth according to uh judeo-christian tradition in the west is that humans are monogamous and heterosexual but that's not true uh and and so a number of things flow from that and so by evaluating with socratic reasoning they said okay you made this premise is it always true no okay let's move on so from from that post-modernism emerged which basically says nothing is true there are no universal truths everything should be questioned um and that's where we are today we are still mired in post-modernism where the prevailing belief is that there are no truth that is a that is considered a first principle is that there is nothing that is true it's all relative um it's a very frustrating thing um but it does have its value we're also mired in nihilism so part of what has happened is ever since the inventing of the printing press the church has had less and less power um the because of this move towards intellectualism um because the church no longer had a monopoly on thought and writing um things became began to be evaluated and so you had people like martin luther and protestantism and this fracturing this repeated fracturing of the church which kind of had a monopoly on morality amongst other things but also it had a monopoly on philosophy well at the end of the 19th century there is a lot of intellectual movements about like okay what is it that's true humans have a really hard time of breaking away from the schemas on which we are raised and so a lot of people in the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century such as um eugene rose or saint francis uh friar seraphim were raised with religion and they could not break away from this god-centric view of the world and so but if you get rid of god if you get rid of this all-powerful being this all-loving being and you're left with nothing then you inevitably come to the conclusion that nothing matters everything is meaningless which is a really really awful place to be so that's what nihilism is now there's this book is uh it it really bends over backwards to promote the idea of positive nihilism or optimistic nihilism which basically says ah you don't have to fear hell and damnation and you don't have to impress um this omniscient god so therefore you're free to do whatever you want um that falls flat because humans need purpose we'll get into purpose in a little bit with the genius myth so basically eugene rose he tried to get away from a religious mindset and he literally like opens the book by talking about how he became a bohemian and he was in with the post-modernists and but he was so cripplingly depressed because he had no purpose in life that he ended up just laying on the floor drinking himself to death in a studio apartment in new york or a basement apartment in new york just like laying on the floor screaming about how lonely he was and so he went back to religion and and basically did a 180 and said uh nihilism and post-modernism are wrong it's a tool of the devil we all need to go back to religion um that's his view um yeah so post-modernism and nihilism are at the root of a lot of these discussions we are in an age of scientific inquiry and empiricism so empiricism says that everything must be observable there must be some physical phenomenon at the root of everything this is also called materialism um so materialism says that like whatever whatever goes on is a is a is a result of matter and energy and that includes consciousness so then we've got let's see where did it go chalmers a popular modern [Music] philosopher is kind of in the materialist school of thought where you know he looks at which regions of the brain um excuse me uh give rise to certain things um but he is he remains just a philosopher so if you want a hardcore materialist view of what consciousness is i recommend phantoms in the brain and by vs ramachandran so anyways materialism and empiricism are kind of a result of throwing out the idea of souls and spirits and religion and anything immaterial so because where we are today is that we have we have decided that um we're just going to throw all that out and we're going to say no there is no such thing as anything immaterial so we are going to focus on the material the real and the and energy and matter and that is that is empiricism that is where we are today with science however um well actually before we move on i will say that people like ramachandran who is a neuroscientist he does a really good job of showing how consciousness and sentience are modified and dependent on the operation of the brain so that seems to indicate that maybe materialism is correct if the brain goes offline you go offline if you have a lesion on the brain that prevents you from interpreting um reading you could look at these symbols and say like okay that's just squiggles on a on a book but i can't recognize and there's actually conditions where you can't even recognize objects where you just say that's a thing i don't know what it is but it's a thing so if your brain can break and you become less conscious or less sentient and or less sapient and able to process the world that lends credence to the idea that perhaps that our brains are purely materialistic in that um everything about our consciousness emerges from uh from uh physical systems and energy so this friend that i um that i talked to he said okay you know if we if we go if we start with you know chalmers and materialism and we say consciousness is just a matter of calculation anything that does the does the correct calculations and we're talking from a quantum perspective right quantum information is being processed um you know this book is quantum information it's going through interactions it's quantum information is being processed and so that gives rise to the idea of pan psychism which is like okay the human brain is just matter and energy it's doing quantum calculations therefore um if there's nothing else special about us then consciousness can emerge from anything that does the correct calculations and perhaps everything is conscious pan psychism it's just maybe its experience of being is very different from ours so that's pansysm and and i was not convinced but having a conversation with my friend um he said like yeah like what's different from you know a human brain or a tree right um and and this is this is why i'm making in other videos because there's a lot of comments um and people have talked about this kind of stuff and i was like you know maybe i was a little dismissive at first but then after this conversation with a friend it really started uh kind of fermenting um okay so if we are anchored in materialism and empiricism and we say consciousness is just a matter of doing the right calculations okay then sure with the right set of apis and large language models then then a machine could be fully conscious could be fully sentient however we get to where did it go we get to quantum physics and sorry i got a stack of books okay philosophy of physics quantum theory um the prince and foundations of contemporary philosophy this book looks at i think it's seven different um quantum mechanics experiments over the last uh 80 plus years um and then when you look at quote quotations from people like niels bohr and other um other you know the grandfathers of quantum mechanics they all came to the conclusion that human consciousness is uh is critical to the existence of the universe so then we end up with some stuff like the anthropic principle a strong anthropic principle as proposed by barrow and tipler state that the universe in some sense is compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life will emerge within it um so basically like something about the universe seems that like we inevitably must exist um but anyways point being is that a lot of quantum physicists have come to the conclusion that consciousness is absolutely critical for the existence of the universe and so that gives rise to things like the measurement problem so the measurement problem is if you um if if you don't have something that met that makes a measurement and then that measurement doesn't end up in a human mind does the does the uh wave function collapse and that's a gross oversimplification anyways point being there are things like delayed choice experiments in quantum physics which basically shows that um the universe time does not does not move linearly to the universe the universe will sort of reverse engineer what must have been what must needed to have been true in the past in order to make the the present situation correct or interpretable um and so uh then there's also the concept of non-locality um so like quantum non-locality uh is rising and it's right it's in the ascendancy um where the real world does not seem to be anchored to what is physically you know distance or physical distance doesn't seem to matter as much and so the image that is emerging is that materialism or realism is not accurate materialism and realism explain much of what we see but it can't explain everything okay so we've set the stage for materialism for realism um for empiricism and then uh you know we've also talked about the the philosophical state that we're in which is post-modernism and nihilism near-death experiences so there's a book life after life this actually codified near-death experiences but research is ongoing i strongly recommend you watch these videos from university of california riverside um i devoured this book and then watched a bunch of videos so and read you don't have to take my word for it you know read the books watch the videos phenomenon of near-death experiences defeat in my mind completely defeat the idea of materialism so what happens during a near-death experience is that you go through a traumatic event most often a car crash because that is something that that is one of the most common traumatic events today um that is life-threatening um but any any any number of things um near-death experiences can happen during surgeries cancer treatments heart attacks all sorts of stuff and because our medical system is better today more people survive things that they would not have survived 100 years ago so there are thousands of reports of near-death experiences every every year now and um this book talks about you know there the common patterns between those near-death experiences there's you know going through the tunnel head towards the light an encounter with some sort of being is is one of the most common mainstays of of a near-death experience but also before that people often have a disembodied feeling where they are looking down at themselves from a third party perspective in other cases they're led by some kind of angelic figure or other entity and they can see things and hear things that are happening away from their body one of the most common things experiences that doctors have is that someone was clinically dead or otherwise you know they were offline and they wake up and they have memories of conversations that happened around them or in in in many cases conversations that happened elsewhere in the hospital entirely so they wake up and they have access to information that cannot be explained by materialism and so what near-death experiences show what they demonstrate is that human consciousness is not always anchored to a physical body sure you look at phantoms in the brain and your the the health the physical health of your brain does have a huge impact on what you know what you think what you can do your perception right um schizophrenia and other problems drastically modify your perception however you look at near-death experiences and there are many many books about this now um plenty of youtube videos there are there there are cases that cannot be explained by materialism um and so you have this one tiny kernel of truth and the implications of that are incredible because if materialism can be defeated right or if it's if it's not always true right socratic reasoning if materialism is not always true then the materialist explanation of the universe is also not always true or not complete i also read dmt the spirit molecule dmt is suspected to to possibly be one of the substances responsible for near-death experiences it's released by what is it the pineal gland and it goes directly into the brain there's a very short path that allows your body to release dmt very fast if needed but dmt experiences are remarkably similar to near-death experiences where you become disembodied um you you think or you communicate with an entity at the speed of thought and even if it only lasts a few minutes or a few seconds you can feel like a lifetime there have been reports of people um going through dmt experiences that it felt like centuries um and so between these between these artificially created experiences and then these accidental experiences it seems like there is mounting evidence and can and consensus that materialism cannot explain all aspects of human consciousness that our consciousness can in some cases be detached from our body um and of course two deeply religious people who believe in souls all along they're like well duh right but i was raised completely irreligious um i have i have never even read a uh a page of religious scripture in my entire life i've never read anything from the bible i've never read anything from the torah or the quran so i'm coming to this from a completely irreligious perspective now one thing that occurs to me is like let's see where did the book go um you know like eugene rose um many people were raised with you know completely saturated and immersed in the judeo-christian tradition which talks about souls like so even before you know i came to these ideas i knew the idea of a soul right like you know all the christians all the all the religious people say that we have some kind of soul some kind of spirit um and so i knew about that idea even without being religious so is it possible that like my interpretation is being colored or coded by um by the the social milieu that i've grown up in absolutely that's that's impossible to separate that out now what i will say though is that other books and studies about near-death experiences and dmt both show that the experiences are very similar regardless of what culture you're in uh so like near-death experiences in japan or singapore or thailand um are very similar to near-death experiences in america and europe as our dmt experiences now the words that people choose to describe their experiences might change based on their culture right but not always so if we pause for a second and say you know because of you know quantum physics says like okay the world isn't the universe is not real we're moving towards it a non-real interpretation where matter and energy are not the be-all end-all of existence and then we look at near-death experiences and dmt experiences that seem to to comport with that and say that consciousness is not always 100 anchored to something that is a physical or material system what then right does that mean that that there is something special about us that we have souls that are reincarnated or something i don't know there are a lot of uh there are a lot of different interpretations this video in particular um by john martin fisher he addresses all this so if you want to engage more with this i recommend this video or the books that i just showed you um let's see get clean up my desk a little because i've got all these okay so that's the background if all if if the direction that i'm moving and the direction that science is moving which is away from materialism away from realism and away from local realism and towards um a dualist uh interpretation uh towards uh um a non-local and non-real interpretation of of the universe what does that mean does that mean that like there are gods and spirits i don't know um it's possible uh but but basically so this professor he does a much better job of explaining he comes up short saying like materialism doesn't satisfy everything does that mean that it's divine i don't remember the word that he uses he's like i can't make that claim but all i can say is that materialism doesn't satisfy so if materialism does not satisfy our the an explanation for our consciousness what does that mean about machine intelligence and machine consciousness um i don't know but what it what what my current interpretation that's not the one that i wanted to show my current interpretation is that phenomenal consciousness which is that subjective experience of us being it is it is like something to be us we have a subjective experience that is almost impossible to articulate but the obviousness of it is that we have this conscious experience i am starting to believe that maybe this is a characteristic that is unique to living things um i'm not gonna you know say like only humans have souls um i can't make that claim um but uh it it seems like there is something special about about being us um yeah so genius myth i talked about how eugene rose was very depressed because he had moved away from from god and and he needed to go back because he needed to have a purpose genius myth talks about finding a purpose with or without religion um remarkable book um and and well my brain is drawing a blank as to why i feel the need to talk about it so i'll just set this down for right now um okay so going back to materialism this book brain trust which looks at morality and ethics from a neuroscience perspective and an evolutionary perspective this book comports very well with my book benevolent by design so one of the things that patricia churchlin says in this book is that the entire purpose of a nervous system you central nervous system which is your brain and your peripheral nervous system which is um uh your the your sensation and your motor control and and even your um enteric nervous system which is your your guts your innards the purpose of these is strictly to help you survive and you know so that's at the first principle is the purpose of the nervous system is to help you survive a higher order purpose is to move away from harm or damage or another word for that is suffering so subjectively we suffer um when we are up when we're when we're approaching death right pain hurts because it represents damage to your body which represents a risk of death and we and it also is to move us towards a state of thriving or a state of of well-being those are the two fundamental purposes of of the central nervous system of our nervous system as a whole and those are directly mirrored by my first two core objective functions which is to one reduce suffering and to increase prosperity so again i always say like i don't i haven't invented anything i'm just building off of what other people have discovered um so if we have that as the first two principles of the the primary purposes of our nervous system well then what the heck is the purpose of our if if we have a soul if we have phenomenal consciousness why like the universe is way more complex if we're not just biological entities that are you know where you and i are a little better than ants right um in terms of our function we you know we eat we reproduce we eventually die um so what's the difference and so uh michael mead in the genius myth talks about finding a more transcendent purpose um your higher purpose your soul's purpose your divine purpose right because if we have an immaterial uh or a non-real or a non-materialistic um view of our consciousness then you know we there the possibilities are endless right the skies are the limit there's two there's too many possibilities to calculate which is why i have the third objective function as increase understanding the quest to understand to learn is to me my highest purpose and that's why i have my youtube channel that's why i'm doing these videos and so the conclusion that i can come to right now is will a machine ever have phenomenal consciousness like us it's hard to say right if if if materialism was true and consciousness was just a matter of performing the correct calculations then i would say yes absolutely machines could have a consciousness equal to or more sophisticated than our own however it seems like there is a non-material component of human of the human experience of our consciousness that cannot be explained by materialism that cannot be explained by matter and energy as we understand it today maybe it's entirely possible that we'll discover you know um magnetic or other energetic fields and patterns of energy around our heads that explain um you know near-death experiences if that's the case if materialism ultimately can't explain everything then yeah the the answer is as obvious if materialism ultimately can explain everything if empiricism ultimately can explain everything then can we say that lambda or a machine like it is is fully sentient is fully conscious like us absolutely but that is the key question is materialism true or false right now it's looking like no materialism does not explain everything and there's this whole other realm of of reality or existence that we can barely even begin to describe and so that's the key question and so whenever i whenever i say like on the forums or whatever when i say like this will be decades or centuries of debate that's what i mean is this the answer to whether or not a machine that can behave like us has an experience like us will take a long time to figure out and it's because of this this debate that's rooted in where we're at today which is nihilism post-modernism and then and then the question of quantum mechanics is the is the universe real or non-real is the universe local or non-local and right now it seems like the universe is non-real and non-local and it seems like materialism cannot explain everything and so because of that the question of machine consciousness is infinitely harder to answer if the world if if the if if if the world or the universe is materialistic if the universe if if quantum mechanics is local and real then it's simple brain dead simple the short answer is yes however those three things do not appear to be true right now so we got to keep we got to keep going and that's why um third core objective function is increase understanding because until we understand we don't have the right answer and so that's uh that's that um i hope you found this video helpful as part of a discussion of this in my first book natural language cognitive architecture i said that i'd leave it up to the philosophers to have this debate but here i am fully entrenched in the trenches of this debate um and uh and this is where we're at um so yeah uh thanks for all the comments and um yeah please keep the discussion up i'm really curious to hear what you all have to think about what i've shared here i'll have a link to all these links in the video description as well as all the books that i've listed here so thanks for watching
