hey everyone david shapiro here with a quick video um i got this fancy new uh camera light let me show you real quick it's uh one of these ring lights um yeah just trying to improve my production quality um so now you can see every detail in my face and like wow under a microscope anyways sorry um this video is going to be really quick i'm just going to talk about uh some of my predictions for the future of ai jobs i have been keeping my finger on the pulse of data science jobs for quite a while i remember about eight plus years ago before like data engineer was a thing they called them like data wranglers and i remember watching an interview with a guy who's like i don't really know what i'm doing there's just a lot of data um and so they were talking about like we're they're just kind of inventing the inventing the job as they went along and now there's you know ml ops there's data engineers there's datatex there's data scientists right and so that is and now you watch on um on like towards data science you see that a lot of these people are getting burned out it's not sustainable the job landscape is changing a lot of those jobs are getting automated away by new platforms and new pieces of software so that's changing quickly and then there's this other trend happening where you get this hybridization where someone comes from a biology background and they learn to use machine learning or data science tools about five years ago or so there was a lot of gatekeeping where a lot of folks on reddit and other places were like uh well you shouldn't even get into data science unless you have a phd in math right there's all kinds of gatekeeping happening that has kind of toned down because uh the free market demands like hey we need people that can do this we don't care about your credentials as long as you can do it as long as you've got the experience and the track record kaggle really took off that was a big game changer because there was a scarcity of phds with it but also just because you have a phd in something doesn't necessarily mean that those skills transfer uh especially to some of these practical um things that like the competitions on kaggle or if you have a phd in math you know where or you have a phd in biology or whatever um yeah most phds that i know are very intelligent and can transfer skills but that being said there is still a dearth of phds and so they needed to the industry the technology industry um needed to bring in people that can do anything so they started recruiting at deep learning groups and kaggle competitions and that sort of thing uh so that has that has been the cha the trade um trend there we go trend that i've seen and then okay so that's kind of where we are today so what do i think is going to happen in the future well large language models such as gbt3 and and um you know megatron and i don't even know what the biggest ones are what was it chinchilla i think was one of the other more recent ones um i have said it before and i'll say it again and that is that computer scientists are not always the best with language um you need someone who understands linguistics in order to make the most of these tools that's why prompt engineering i'm like study you know higher higher humanities major um it's really interesting because my girlfriend has noticed the same thing she's doing her thesis with gpt3 and she showed it to a librarian and librarians get it they're just like this is so cool like ask it this question ask it this question and they rapidly cycle through because they understand language you show it to a philosopher a psychologist they all get it really quick and the way that i kind of describe it to people is that a lot of computer scientists and not all many computer scientists get it but some don't get it because they can't see the forest for the trees or they can't see the language for the math right they're math first folks and so they see the algorithm the code the architecture and they don't really fully understand like what it means to have billions of ideas embedded in a network so my first prediction took me four and a half minutes to get to it my first prediction is that uh is that we're gonna see a huge surge in hiring humanities um majors in in the space of natural language um large language models so you're gonna see english majors you're gonna see philosophers psychologists all kinds of other people getting ai jobs um that is one of my biggest early prediction and and there's a lot of reasons for this but most importantly is just if you've got like a mental model of how to process language like that's a great start um so another prediction is that automation i don't think is going to go the way that a lot of people think it's going to go when some people think of automation and low-hanging fruit they think of like you know automating away burger flippers that's been tried okay you can have fast food robots um the kiosks you know that like at panera bread and wherever else they're popping up everywhere that's low hanging fruit one thing is the automation that you don't see so like lights out factories those are coming so the idea of a lights out factory is you don't have a single human working in a factory floor everything is handled by machines and automation and what you do is you have someone in a control tower somewhere else you know checking on all the robots and they're playing it like a strategy game right like a real-time strategy game where you're collecting resources and finishing missions um and eventually that's going to be automated too um i have worked with a couple of startups that are interested in doing this with lawyers well talk to them i didn't really work with them i just had a couple of zoom calls with them to say like yeah this would work so law in particular is highly susceptible to automation with large language models because law is all text it is 100 text based every court case has transcripts every filing is all text 100 text the only thing that is not text is um is actually like trial cases but you could have like most cases um don't ever go to trial right most court cases are contract negotiation um uh mediation which is just like you submit paperwork you file things it's back and forth you can automate the entire process um i had a contract that i had to review it was about 80 pages and so what i did was i used gpt3 to summarize it for myself so it went from like 80 pages to like 16. um yeah so like you do that and you you you automate you know contract revision summarization um one thing that i learned in talking with some of these lawyers is they keep copies of everything so you have many law offices that have thousands and thousands of contract revisions um and i told them i was like that is that is a gold mine of fine tuning data i was like that is a billion dollars worth of data right there because you can automate contract revisions that cost millions of dollars and typically take years of negotiation you have two machines working you know adversarially to negotiate a big contract between you know government and a company or two companies or whatever you know the law the law industry is going to be turned on its head within the next few years the biggest limitation right now is that gpt 3 has a very limited window as that window gets bigger and you can feed in an entire contract uh yeah you're going to see some major changes with automation and law that's that's probably going to be the biggest thing and it's going to happen fast because you're going to get new disruptions coming in and rather than have a lawyer look at everything manually you're going to have paralegals working with these automation tools and then you know the the lawyer the you know the person who's actually got the jd and has has crossed the bar or passed the bar exam they're just going to sign off on it and a lot of these things are going to be like 80 page contracts contracts are going to get much longer too because you're going to get really specific because it's going to be super easy to just say add another clause that does this and boom writes it done i did some experiments with that gpt3 is already really close uh it's it's frighteningly close um i think that's going to happen before code automation comes along before programmers get replaced however i think that we're going to end up with some really interesting programming tools so i said on another podcast that i think that one thing that we're going to see is we're going to integrate like codex or copilot the the gpt3 coding tools integrate those with discord and where you just say you know hey programmer bot write a function that does this and put it over in this file and then test it and then you know it gives you test results and you're like okay let's troubleshoot this and then so coding is going to be like a group chat thing and you're not going to have an ide right you're going to do it through slack or discord or microsoft teams or whatever so i think that i think that we're going to see the devops pipeline really really change and so you're not going to need to be an expert in an individual functions or anything but rather you're going to need to understand how pieces of software plug in together and how to interact with a chat bot to get it to program the things that you want um that is something that i think is going to happen pretty soon a lot of that testing automation cycle is just going to be through through chat right um yeah i think that those are probably you know so you know language focus on humanities law overhaul and then coding through through natural language and chat bots i think that's that's good for now that's a 10 minute video thanks for watching like and subscribe etc etc you know the drill
