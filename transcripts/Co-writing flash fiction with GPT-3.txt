hey everyone david shapiro here with a video about co-writing with gpt3 um so co-writing is something that you can do it's pretty easy um usually you use the older engine kind of kind of the default settings and you just provide just a little bit of framing and then you start writing a story so let's say uh let's not use let's use a steve steve hadley you're not supposed to start fiction with woke up but we're amateur riders woke up on the martian transit um transit vessel uh what should the name of this ship be um the brain brain fart um let's just call it the the frog prince sure um sorry i haven't had enough coffee today uh the alarms were blaring something had gone horribly wrong all right let's see what gpt3 says oh this is great all right that's enough okay the ship was falling out of orbit and plummeting towards the martian surface it would only be a matter of minutes before the ship crashed into the frigid wastes what had gone wrong steve hadley had been a test pilot for 33 years he had devoted his life to the research and development of nasa's next generation spacecraft he had led test flight teams for the hermes hermes wasn't that from the martian the first ship to fly to mars he had piloted the first successful flight to mars now the hermes was a distant memory and he was commander of the martian transit ship the frog prince the martian transit system was the world's first commercial space transportation system they promised to take passengers to mars for a fraction of the cost of conventional space travel they promised to open up the solar system to mankind this is great um maybe maybe perhaps not the most compelling pros but this would certainly work for some people and you pass this by an editor it'll it'll be great promised to open up the solar system first they had not taken a single customer to mars second no one knew if the martian transit system would actually work the frog prince had a revolutionary new propulsion system powered by a series of fusion reactors that would fire a precise schedule four point five percent the speed of light good lord um that's fast all right let's do that read on the situation but all the telemetry was dead warning um please correct flight path okay so sorry i should have been saying that out loud steve tried to get a read on the situation but all the telemetry was dead warning orbital catastrophe detected please correct flight path fight flight path there we go i know how to speak i promise steve says she said i know i don't exactly want to end up as a smear and what is it called planitia let's see if it knows what i'm talking about okay it says please calculate a counter maneuver the ai responded here that's plenty the ai responded i have detected the problem the ship is nose diving into the martian surface there's nothing we can do to correct the problem we should prepare for impact this is not a survivable event wow okay this is super grim dark the ship's hull began to groan in creek the frog prince was a marvel of material science it was composed of super lightweight composite materials it was designed to withstand the intense heat of atmospheric entry it was designed to withstand the shock of landing on the martian surface it had never been designed to withstand an uncontrolled reentry the ai said impact in 30 seconds steve said at least tell me where i'm going to die let's see and then it starts repeating itself so that's fine um unknown since let's see navigational sensors are down fantastic steve thanks steve but then an incident from his academy days percolates up into his mind his buddy jonah had run a similar situation but that was only in training sims what was it that jonah did steve says pulling files says the ai it turns out jonah had okay keeps going um essentially use the ship the force of the ship's propulsion to slow their descent steve had to be quick he had to figure out the math before they hit hey what's the acceleration of the ship unknown i do not have a valid trajectory solution how much fuel do i have left okay so it's super super repetitive that's fine i know just do it i've performed a new there's no okay that's not exactly what i was what i was using what i was hoping for so let's do let's increase frequency penalty to 0.5 clear this out and try again okay he didn't uh let's see use the ship's attitude thrusters to adjust the ship's orientation the problem was that jonah used all his propellant steve was out of propellant he didn't have any to keep the ship stable he would have to do something different the ascent warning impact in 15 seconds noted maybe i could use the attitude thrusters to slow down when could i use the parachutes to slow down even more are you insane says the ai i don't have time for your opinion punch it you do realize i am programmed with a strict protocol against suicide oh man this isn't suicide it's an experiment in engineering oh this is great this is getting more interesting if it works we'll be saved if it doesn't we're dead anyways please humor me oh man this is wonderful steve had a lot of experience with landing on mars with conventional rockets but those rockets were designed for precision landings with parachutes and airbags if frog prince had neither parachutes nor airbags it would be like landing an elephant on a basketball court oh that's great i love this i love this the reluctant ai made four million calculations and adjustments in a split second and enacted steve's plan without external telemetry um there was no way of knowing [Music] if it was working the only way they would find out is if they didn't suddenly explode steve squeezed his eyes shut but then the alarms stopped and the ai chimed touchdown successful the ground crews at the martian starport were running out to greet steve when he exited the frog friends all right let's see where it goes with that the ship's hull had been breached and a cold martian air was pouring into the ship the ground crew had been expecting to recover a dead crew instead they found steve alive and well what happened ask a lead ground crewman i'm not sure said steve one minute i was falling out of control and the next i was floating down to the surface we were expecting to recover a dead man said the lead ground crewman maybe you should consider a different line of work that's great the ai the ai chimed in you would be surprised how often re-entry accidents result in miracles steve just shook his head and said i guess chaos theory is alive and well man this is nice this is really creative the frog prince never flew again but it didn't have but it didn't have to because within two weeks of landing another ship landed with enough customers there was already a waiting list for sheets on other ships that would be flying soon after dave shapiro is an aerospace engineer who has worked on rockets for nasa oh that's very sweet i actually haven't done that boeing and spacex okay cool so it knows what spacex is he lives in seattle with his wife and two sons his short stories have appeared in analog science fiction in fact his short story the martian transit was one honorable mention at the 2014 writers of something okay so here you have it here is a uh here's a co-written short story with uh with gpth3 it is 1200 tokens long which is about um what is it one token so one it's about one word per token if you use conventional ones um some longer words like super lightweight this could be three or four tokens so let's just say this is about a thousand words so this is flash fiction um yeah i had no idea where it was going you saw i just i just gave it an opening prompt and then it just took it and ran with it i did use vanilla davinci which is much better at just writing long form stuff like this i left the the temperature at 0.7 because if you go up too high it gets crazy i did ultimately put the frequency penalty up to 0.5 which forces it to be a little bit more creative so the frequency penalty what this does is the more times a token appears the less likely it is to appear again which is really critical if you're writing long form stuff if you turn this all the way up though you'll end up with really weird things where like the period there will be a space between the periods and stuff because it's like oh well i can't i can't keep using periods because those are uh you know those are those are common tokens um and so if you turn the frequency penalty up too high you'll end up without the ability to use like normal punctuation so there are limits to that but yeah there you have it we just co-wrote a speculative fiction and thriller uh in just a few minutes thanks for watching i hope you liked it
