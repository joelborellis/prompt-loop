morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video so a couple couple days ago or last week whenever I did a quick uh cover letter chatbot generator um it was pretty popular um but I saw on um the gpd3 subreddit someone was asking for more help with cover letters and resumes so I figured let's make this into a bigger project so the most annoying part about filling out resumes is entering your information repeatedly so what I was I was uh gonna rather than create a chat bot that asks you the same questions every time I figured let's just go ahead and pre-load a bunch of these questions so like what is your name the company you're applying for so there's just a couple of variables to update each time how many years of experience do you have what are your professional strengths but a lot of this won't change right um let's see so then we'll add questions like um why are you excited about this particular job role um that's probably about it um let's see what about the job stands out to you why are you a great fit um okay so that's probably good enough so what I'm doing here is I'm just saving some of these answers in a Json file and so I'll fill it out for myself David Shapiro you all know me what is the job you're applying for um senior cognitive architect um what is the role you're oh wait no that's the derp uh we'll we'll call it uh um Acme robot Sciences um okay a senior cognitive architect how many years of experience do you have uh total I got like you know we'll say 16 years of experience um let's see what are your greatest professional strengths um I think extremely fast um what are your professional growth desires I want to create a new field of research artificial cognition what kind of environment do you prefer um very relaxed uh Pace but technically challenging what does your ideal work day look like um flexible hours I tend to work very early um in the morning let's see why are you excited about this particular job role this is my absolute top passion I want to uh let's see create robots and machines that will um replace all human labor so we can live a life of luxury basically I just want to be on vacation all the time we want to go to so my fiance and I we want to go like all over Europe uh we want to go to like the Greek Islands so that's that's the future that I want let's see what about the job stands out to you why are you a great fit I am a great fit because I have already written a few books about artificial cognition Okay so we've got some we we just got some off the cuff things here um so let's see so we'll take this we'll start here and this is just like boilerplate stuff so open file save file load info um so myinfo.json if you want to use this just update this um and then also you'll need to update uh update this create the file if you need to um yeah so then all right so first thing we'll do is we'll do um info equals load info um so that will just um so show you what this does real quick so do um python cover letter definitions is not defined oh I had something yep I had something left over I copy pasted it from other code there we go Okay so we've got all of it um here so then what we want to do is actually what we need here we also need to add a label field so what do I mean by a label field so a label is we need to do a labeled list so basically because if you just put you know name like all these answers like 16 with no context it doesn't make any sense so gpt3 will need some kind of label so we'll just say label name um uh let's see and here we'll copy this out and so we get more complete data um okay so label name um company applying for a company applying to um role applying to and actually we don't need the semicolon I will add that in programmatically um years of experience um greatest strength I keep putting in the simply colon It's like automatic um let's see professional goal um my ideal work environment and then um my ideal work day and then why I am uh let's see excited and then finally why I'm a great fit okay so basically and you'll you'll see when this is populated um I'll probably trim that out a little bit okay so then let's run this again so you can just see expecting value huh I must have missed something oh right so Json doesn't like it if you have a trailing comma python doesn't care but Json does not like a trailing trailing comma okay oh and I added semicolon there whoops my brain is on autopilot I've already had coffee I guess I need more um okay so we've got our info and then what we need is a prompt so the prompt is going to be something real simple like um let's see given the following I know write a highly professional cover letter with following information um yeah so we probably just start there and then we'll do um info so that'll be that and then we'll do like um highly professional cover letter so gpt3 already knows what a cover letter is but if we don't get the right format we'll do a few shot prompt where I'll go find one on the internet and um and give it because with the instruct series you you often don't need examples but if you want really good examples that are very consistent then you can um you can you can give it just one or two examples and you'll get the same benefits that you get from from few shot training okay so we'll say prompt cover letter dot text okay so now we also have to format the um the the block uh and actually we probably don't need the question well the question is here for your sake for when you fill it out um so but then we'll just have the the label and the answer okay so text block equals blah and so then we'll say 4i and info we'll say text block plus equals and so then we'll say um string string and we'll do paren or a percent so I is going to be labeled and then we'll do I answer and then we need to add a new line at the end and so then we'll do print text block make sure that works so basically we're just okay so name company so you see how it's nice nice and formatted um greatest strength I think extremely fast etc etc Okay cool so this is going to be this is going to be inserted into our cover letter and we'll see what happens there so we can comment that out um okay so prompt equals um uh no open file and so we got prompt underscore cover letter dot text um and then we do dot replace info with text block and we'll print out the print our prompt make sure that looks good there we go so we'll just submit this up to gpt3 and see how it goes um okay so completion equals gpd3 completion uh prompt and also before we go that far I need to add a gpt3 logs folder that's not strictly necessary but I save everything out to a log file for a review um it's just what I do uh I like to do that so that we can review things because sometimes you're not necessarily going to expect what you or get what you expect um so all right so we'll print out the completion and then we will go ahead and save file and we'll say um the file name will be cover letter underscore um and we'll put a timestamp in there dot text so then time and then completion and that should be good let's see if this works so it's going to send it up let's see what it gives me back dear Acme robot Sciences I'm writing to apply for the position of senior cognitive architect I have 16 years of experience in the field and my greatest strength is my ability to extreme think extremely fast my professional goal is to create a new field of research artificial cognition I believe I'm a great fit for this position because I've already written a few books about artificial cognition my ideal work environment is one that is very that is that is very relaxed paced that's not great but technically challenging I am excited about this opportunity because it is my absolute top passion I want to create robots and machines that will replace all human labor so we can live a life of luxury so it's basically just copy pasting what I wrote um thank you for your time and consideration sincerely David Shapiro okay not bad so it basically took the information that I gave it and and massaged it into something um I'm not exactly happy with this so um I'm gonna pause the video real quick and find some some uh some example cover letters and see if we can just embellish this just a little bit okay looking at some examples of cover letters I think the thing that's missing uh that meant that many of these have is um there's kind of a list in the middle of you know what you've achieved so like here's a short one that's okay um you know one paragraph okay that's not not necessarily the best but usually there's a list right in the middle of of kind of like uh top achievements so let's come back to our data and so here's here's where using something like this is uh good because then you just add a little bit more so like greatest strength um so then we'll add um like list of achievements um so like what are your um let's see pop achievements um list so my answer is um let's see talk achievements will be the label um so let's see what are my top achievements um let's see I wrote three books about artificial cognition and architectures um let's see I started a successful YouTube Channel documenting my work and research I published more than a hundred open source projects on GitHub so that should be good all right so all I had to do was just add this and I don't have to change any code so this allows you to rapidly customize and get better results but one thing that I wanted to change about the prompt cover letter um let's see um let's see fix typos spelling and word choice if there are any mistakes okay so highly professional cover letter um so just by adding this if there's any if there's any like lowercase whatever here we should get a little bit better results oh and also there should be a um yeah cover letter here so it just saves the example um all right so let's see what happens this time I keep reaching for my coffee mug and it's still empty imagine that okay so yeah so just by giving it a little bit more input um let's see my greatest strength is my ability to think extremely fast this has allowed me to achieve many great things in my career such as writing three books about artificial cognition and architectures starting a successful YouTube channel and Publishing more than 100 open source so again it's just kind of copy pasting um New Field of artificial research within artificial our new field of research within that I believe that Acme robot there we go okay perfect so by giving it just a little bit more information it's getting a little bit more creative I believe that Acme robot science is the perfect place to achieve this goal as it is a company that is at the Forefront of technological innovation bam got it okay I'm excited about this opportunity because it represents my absolute passion um yep so I believe that I am a great fit for this role because my extensive experience perfect perfect perfect Okay so we've got a good cover letter now at the top of your resume um well here I'll run this again real quick um so at the top of your resume you should always have a professional objective section um because not everyone reads a cover letter um academic institutions medical institutions they are more likely to read your cover letter but if you're applying for a tech company often the cover letter is completely discarded so for instance as on the on the hiring side um I uh like HR often just will not pass on a cover letter you just get the resume so what you want to do is have a professional objective section at the top of your resume which is a copy of this but it's extremely cut down so what we'll do is we'll just add we'll take the same text block and we'll say Okay so let's copy this and say write a highly professional um let's see uh let's see write a uh professional objectives um section for the top of a resume um it should be uh just um three sentences or so um it should convey uh a lot uh that should see it should uh this one we might need to give it an example um and summarize the um applicant very well um okay so then we'll say professional objectives paragraph all right so let's just see if this works prompt professional objectives because I got my my current job by having a dynamite professional objective section I actually had help from a friend who is a professional like talent scout and I'm pretty sure my current boss he read my professional objective and like read no further because I said things like you know I like adhering to best practices and raising the bar and you know it's just like okay you you want to convey a lot about your personality in a professional objective section um convey the um the top uh qualities and personality um in the paragraph Okay so let's see if this works so we'll go ahead and we will add so we've already got the text block so then we'll do um another section so then we'll do um get professional objective and so we'll say uh well here we can just copy copy that so instead of prompt cover letter we'll do professional objective and we'll just use the same information we'll get a same completion and instead of save file cover letter will do professional objective okay so let's see how this works we might like I said this because it needs to be more concise I'm not I'm not as as optimistic that it will work well um especially because a professional objective section is a lot less commonly talked about than a cover letter um professional objective Dynamic spell it professional objective odd okay yes I did misspell it professional objective okay there we go and also you see like this is pretty cheap so you can just run it a few times and cherry pick the best parts um let's see I'm a senior cognitive architect with 16 years of experience my greatest strength is that I think extremely fast I've written pretty books about artificial cognition um okay so this is just like condensing it so this is not exactly good um so let's go take a look so professional objective yeah so this is we're getting there but it needs to be a little bit more concise so um I'm gonna pause the video and find some examples so we'll do a few shot here so one moment okay so I went and found um an example of a good professional objective um I don't know if it's the best but we'll see so we'll let this run real quick um so I just invented a person applying to this company and so you see like um professional objective you know they just uh give a little bit actually here um why I'm a great fit um and I was trained in Berlin okay sure so because you want to make sure that there that all the information that makes it in here is available in the input otherwise you're going to encourage confabulation um let's see um I love Berlin so okay so let's go ahead and run this um because you know garbage and garbage out applies if you if the input that you're giving it is not and fully connected to the output then you're telling it invent whatever it is that you want um to want to do let's add a little bit of output here so print and we'll say um a new line new line um uh let's see cover letter and then we'll do the same thing for print new line new line um and then we'll do a professional objective here we go there we go okay so it did it did the style transfer senior cognitive architect at Acme robot science is excited to work on artificial cognition full-time and create robots that can replace human labor have 16 years of experience and written three books in addition to publishing over 100 Source projects bam that is much better much much better okay I I think I want to go get just one more example for um for this but yeah let me show you um let's see go back to Resume Builder so professional objective number two so there it is um actually that might be good enough yeah let's call that a day so you just jump in here I'll delete I'll delete mine you don't need to see mine um but uh yeah so I hear leave one so that it's there um but yeah so you just jump in here um what you'll whoops what you'll need to do is add in your openai API key and update your info but then once you do that you just run cover letter dot pi and it will generate a um a killer um cover letter and and uh and professional objective for you so there you have it thanks for watching um like And subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon have a good day
