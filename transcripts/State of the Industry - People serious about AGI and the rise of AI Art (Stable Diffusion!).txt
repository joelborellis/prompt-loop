morning everybody david shapiro here um so today i'm going to try a slightly different format um as you may or may not know um my latest book is now available uh symphony of thought i just got the first run from the printer ordered um but most people read it electronically so it's up here on github um just search for symphony of thought under under my name i've actually got it pinned up here so if you just go to dave github.comshop all my books are up here and plus my most popular repositories um my most popular one of all time is plain text wikipedia which skyrocketed like a year ago on reddit because it was posted on data hoarders i think i posted it there anyways okay so what i'm going to do today is we're going to take a survey of the state of the industry so i ran a poll um a couple days ago about agi because the conversation on twitter at least seems to have changed and i'm trying to figure out why and i think it's because some of the thought leaders you know ilya um sutscover who uh i think he's still at openai anyways goal is agi a big name in the industry 120 000 followers he has been talking about agi more often um you know and there's some like cryptic messages like we have no choice but to embrace the fundamental uncertainty of life um okay so if this agi does this was a big one if this agi business works out there's a potential to sell poverty etc etc um so but it's not just it's not just him and so what uh what i did was i found some other folks um who uh now go take me to my profile how do i go to my profile home there we go um so there are some other people and i i uh so here's another one like is it me or is ai twitter moving faster than usual yes um and then oh man so we'll get to ai art i think actually state of the industry or state of the art we're going to talk mostly about ai art um but i see these these animations and they're incredible um it's happening faster than i thought it would um here's another great one so just check out my uh my twitter dshap automator but so let me scroll down to the poll yeah okay so i posted a poll this was less than a full day ago but and it's only 19 votes so take it with a grain of salt but um people that that see me on on their twitter feed um there seems to be some agreement it's a it's not a majority anymore it was but there there was a there's a strong plurality that people are taking agi seriously um so there's that um i'm trying to again i'm trying to figure out where that came from because like it's not like it's not like there's been any grand news right you you it's it's it's a dangerous business um just tapping into social media trends because you know it would be ideal if you could just point to like the thing that said like okay this is this is happening um an agi means something to different people um let's see yeah this was a good article um with uh with stable diffusion you may never believe what you see on again anyways that's a agi anyways maybe that's all that i've got up on agi so let's talk about ai art instead so first let me show you an example um so this is this is dolly this was a scene that i was trying to illustrate from my novel this is from the the prologue the opening chapter um and so this was an original dolly generation and now they have out painting and so out painting allows you to expand an image and so you see how much bigger it is so like here's the original and you see it was kind of cut off and then what i what you can do is you can expand it and so you see more of this this giant like cockpit for this spaceship and you see uh you know a couple moons outside and uh this guy sitting here alone i won't spoil who it is or where he is but anyways so i just wanted to show that like yeah this is pretty cool um however with the explosion of of uh like in particular stable diffusion it seems like um it seems like dolly's days are numbered unless they've got something um some announcement in the works so here's where i'll tie it back to agi um openai has been very quiet for the last couple weeks it's been quiet to the point that people um are complaining on the forum about um about the low quality of support feedback um like people are just not getting anything from open ai people from openai are not posting anything anywhere either and so typically in the past this like they go they go like radio silent they go communication blackout just before they announce something big so maybe it's going to be the next version of dolly maybe it's going to be gpt 4. so i remember earlier this year there was in the rumor mill it was that gpt-4 was going to drop late summer or fall well it's late summer slash fall um so maybe they're gearing up to release gpt4 who knows so but let's talk about let's talk about um ai uh art so stable diffusion um it's not the first but it's certainly a game changer um and there's been all kinds of um all kinds of drama surrounding it so first there's the the the um the question of ethics and safety so uh some people uh are concerned excuse me that that air that can generate photorealistic images of anyone doing anything is particularly dangerous i mean you know your imagination is the limit um especially as these models improve so like you know all kinds of graphic stuff you know gore whatever whatever you can imagine it can be generated now um and so it's kind of like well if that's the case is it dangerous or is it unethical and so i will reiterate so i've said this on twitter this is not a particularly strongly held position because um why do i have a picture of data and okay anyways but basically my initial thought this is just kind of where i'm at now i'm not going to defend this position so don't attack me for it um my initial thought is that ai is um and and and generation like this if people want gore and grotesque stuff and porn it already exists in spades um i don't think that that throwing ai in the mix is gonna be any different and you know as an author there's there's in in the history of novels and literature people thought when novels when the penny dreadful came out when when people started reading for pleasure um back in like victorian england people thought that that was going to corrupt society because it was so grotesque and pornographic and stuff and they thought that novels were going to destroy society and destroy art and now of course novel writing has been refined into its own art form um the same was said of cinema that cinema was going to destroy the art form of of um of of theater right that it was you know oh well instead of having stage actors now you have screen actors um same thing ditto for radio so every time we have a new medium come out there's always really really big pushback um from the status quo but also what happens is inevitably um when you have uh a new art a new medium come out um it just expands art so basically what i think that we're seeing is the the in the invention of a new domain of art i see this as no different from the uh creation of um of cinema radio uh video games right you know video games are a some of them are grotesque whatever but video games are a high art form because there's music there's characters there's story depending on the video games that you play the video games that i play um so anyways i'm not too worried about it from an ethics and safety perspective because like you know um there there have been books that have been banned because they were considered to you know pornographic or grotesque or corrupting or whatever but now we don't do that either right it's like okay you know 0.2 on the page where the words hurt you um you know people have a choice as to whether or not they read a book um so i am not worried about ai art nor am i even worried about it displacing um human generated art so like yeah like you might be able to have um you know you see you see the quality of these animations and there's plenty more um there's plenty more i think i had one tagged um so there's this one which is animated with sound it's super creepy i'm not going to play it um but basically what we're going to end up with very soon is animated scenes and then that's going to get strung together to make animated movies and then you know as as large language models advance which you know if gpt4 is coming out or other things um we're gonna see like basically on-demand art uh whether it's still images videos novels whatever actually i was having a conversation with someone where um they they looked at my novel generating um repo and they're like yeah it gets stuck in in repetition they're like well what about what about short stories like couldn't you start there and i was like yeah that's actually probably a better place to start so i might revisit that and just make a short story generator um that's actually not a bad idea um so you know if you have on-demand art uh like how's that gonna change society is that going to take away uh from people but here's the thing is you have people that will consume so much art all day every day so like with the rise of you know i'm old enough i remember napster there was so much hunger to have more music that people would break the law to download music i don't do that anymore because i don't need to because the market responded and gave me spotify right so what if there's going to be like a spotify for ai art and ai music and ai ai literature right like there is so much opportunity here for new businesses and here's the thing is like most movies today are generated largely by machines anyways yes there's a human behind the machine telling it what to do but there's that's no different from the human operating these new tools right so i see ai art as more like a new set of tools for the creative process um yeah that i mean that's that's the primary thing that i wanted to say um on the topic of agi so this is kind of what i'm bouncing back and forth between today on the topic of agi i actually stumbled across this guy um who uh his youtube channel and and uh twitter handle are sentientism um he has done some really great interviews uh and basically his his primary thing is that uh morality and ethics should be centered around all sentient life forms um rather than human and so that is something that he and i agree on we've had some twitter conversations about like hey when when we invent agi it needs to think about all sentient life not just humans i think it should go further i think that agi should should um think about all life forms not just whether or not it's sentient but uh it's you know we don't have to agree on everything um let's see so oh and then i wanted to um talk about ai alignment on linkedin because it's not just on twitter right if you see something on twitter that's one thing but it's also on linkedin and it's also on youtube um so like people are talking about agi like you know here's you just search for ai alignment kyle o'brien applied scientist at microsoft so here is someone who's like legit right and we're like we're having sober conversations about agi and and people aren't talking about it like because up until this year people would talk about agi like it was some distant possibility maybe several decades away um and and they would talk about it like it would like like if you talked about agi people would look at you like you're a ufo enthusiast right like oh you know grab the tinfoil hat but now like people in the industry are taking it seriously so yeah so this is this is my first go at a kind of a state of the art um episode um let me know well i turned off comments because so let me know what you think on on twitter or in the um in the discord and we'll go from there but yeah thanks for watching
