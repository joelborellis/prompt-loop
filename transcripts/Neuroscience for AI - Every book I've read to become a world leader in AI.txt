hey everybody David Shapiro here with a video so with the explosion of chat GPT and the huge influx of people um in this space of large language models and um and AI I figured it was time to revisit a topic uh which I've made videos on in the past didn't get much traction the times have changed interest has changed so here we go Neuroscience for AI every book that I've read to become a world leader in Ai fine-tuning and cognitive architecture um they're not all strictly neuroscience and I'll explain why but okay why cognitive architecture in its various formats is the way of the future the reason is because a large language model on its own even fine-tuned is it's necessary but not sufficient to achieve things like AGI or even many uh uh things that you want such as you know a chatbot with a long-term memory right if you want to put a long-term memory or scratch pad on a chatbot that is already a cognitive architecture albeit a simple one now you can get more complex cognitive architectures such as the ones that I've laid out in my books but there's any number of ways to deploy it but you need to understand the concept and we have exactly one model for strong intelligence although with the rise of machine we will have we will soon have many models of intelligence uh various types so anyways let's get started number one book Phantoms in the brain by vs ramachandran there's a series on this um you can probably find it online uh but yeah so this uh when when you when you study how something breaks that is often more insightful than studying something that's working um so all the number of the ways that the Brain Breaks really shows you a lot about Consciousness and how it works um so there's stuff like blind sight and losing proprioception and all sorts of weird stuff happens very insightful read this uh and you'll start to get an understanding of of just how the brain is structured and composed uh yeah this this is this is where I started like 20 years ago Brain Trust by by Patricia s Churchland so whenever you talk about strong Ai and AGI and stuff the absolute first thing that everyone says is but who gets to Define morality it's impossible to Define first that's post-modernist drivel second no it's not uh morality feels strange because it varies from place to place but just because something varies and you can't find one hard Universal rule that just means that you haven't extrapolated or or abstracted the rules enough Patricia does that by looking at morality and ethics through an evolutionary and neuroscience perspective once you understand the evolutionary purpose of morality and ethics it makes sense across the world even when it changes like where when and where is it okay to commit murder when and where is it okay to throw babies off cliffs when and where is it okay to deliberately starve someone right these are all super problematic things um and the the the Neuroscience basis as to how and why we are capable of these things um is all explained and elucidated in Brain Trust it is critical uh for understanding kind of the under underlying Machinery of of morality and ethics and by extension understanding what rules and heuristics can go into giving a machine a sense of morality and ethics next up Neuroscience for dummies by Frank anthor um this is a incredibly dense book it's so valuable and it starts with the very Basics such as how do neurons work all the way up through memory cognition dreams everything it's really great I have it on my all of these on my bookshelf right there but I cannot stress this one it's really dense it's like three miles wide but an inch deep but it gives you a really good overview a very good survey of Neuroscience a thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins so this one made a big splash uh a couple years ago and um he's got he's got a good history in terms of things that he's worked on and a pretty good theory um I don't think it's a complete Theory but it is very important to understand that the brain is composed of some kind of repeating circuits or components and then you can extrapolate that out into microservices or other things in the AI space again can't recommend this one enough um I don't think it's the be all end-all but it's still very valuable information on task by David Bader this one is an unsung hero so once you have a machine that can think about anything and do any tasks how do you know what to do this book solves that problem so um uh staying on task or cognitive control is is the is the problem is so cognitive control is deciding what to do when and why and it comes down to two primary uh cognitive behaviors one is Task selection prioritizing what to do and then task switching which is changing tasks depending on uh whatever circumstances are going on this book elucidates this in a great way and it does it in a really good easy to read way cannot recommend this one enough especially if you're building robots or anything that's autonomous the language Instinct by Stephen Pinger so this is where we're starting to get into Linguistics and obviously large language models are all the rage right now so it would make sense to study language um one thing that I've noticed is that a lot of math and computer science folks don't really understand language so if you want to understand the ins and outs of language I would recommend starting here now this book is a little bit dated but it is still very uh very highly selling because of uh it's kind of a a cardinal work in the field some of the stuff is contested now but it still it puts it together in a way that makes you think about language and how infinitely flexible it is and it will dispel a lot of myths that you have about language um and and you you if you read this I hope you will come to the same belief that I have which is that natural language is um absolutely strong enough to carry us through AGI and Beyond the forgetting Machine by Rodrigo Kian kiroga I'm probably saying his name wrong um someone recommended this to me on I think it was YouTube about a year or so ago and this one is really uh important for understanding um one memory of course it's talking about the forgetting machine but two how low bandwidth our brain is um it's in in terms of what our brain is able to do on just a few kilobits a second or a few megabits a second at most it's incredible and so he lays it all down he gives examples does the math and this will really make you think about how much information actually needs to get transferred and stored um for a cognitive architecture and the answer is not as much as you think foreign the checklist Manifesto by Atul gawandi now you might say this is a business book why is it in a neuroscience list and I say BS this is 100 a neuroscience book because he elucidates why we need checklists there are limitations to our brain in terms of following procedures and designing procedures um and also for coming up with rules for systemizing things this book is absolutely one of the most important books you will read of this century case closed it will teach you about the different kinds of lists and procedures so for instance you know you might say oh well you can't you can't make a procedure for that because you have to follow rules but what if one of the what if one of the steps is you know do something like go back to another step or or solve a problem or it's you know you can have very open-ended stuff you don't need stuff that is very very rigid or sometimes a checklist is not even a list of stuff it's a list of principles to follow and so it's not linear right there's all kinds of things you can do with checklists and I have found that large language models understand checklists extraordinarily well this is one of the most powerful tools you will read when doing anything with large language models and cognitive architectures I promise you read this book it's also not that long the pattern Seekers by Simon Baron Cohen so this is about autism and how uh how systemizers um are are have driven much invention throughout all of human history um and there's a reason I read this book and it's because I suspected that I'm on the Spectrum um I score incredibly high on systemizing and I'm weird but anyways that's beside the point um this book talks about patterns pattern recognition and pattern generation and also systemizing things also did you notice that one of these pencils is out of place oh my God I wonder if you did that on purpose anyways so patterns patterns patterns I cannot stress enough how much patterns uh Drive everything all of intelligence is patterns nested patterns fractal patterns whatever it all comes down to patterns so you read this book you will get a better fundamental understanding of not just ordinary intelligence but super intelligence how do you build a machine that's a savant read this book reading like a writer by Francine prose again you might say like why are we why are we talking about writing well large language models are all the rage right now uh so maybe maybe take the opinion of someone who has studied language uh and uh yeah so I promise that if you read this especially especially if you are not trained in in rhetoric or language if you're coming from math and computer science read this book it will give you a fundamentally new understanding of how written language Works which of course if you're working with large language models you need to understand this I'm salty about this by the way um I'm not going to criticize anyone but like the the reason that I'm frustrated is because so many people say oh well language is kind of useless it's too squishy or whatever and I'm like no natural language is absolutely the most powerful uh invention we have um and uh I I will die on this hill and I will not get off my soapbox thank you very much um and uh similarly it was the best of sentences it was the worst of sentences by June Casa Grande um or Casa Grande I don't know anyways this is a similar kind of book which talks about these the the the smallest complete unit of language which is the sentence and this is an entire book about sentences and sentence structure and how sentences work and how to write good sentences you read this book it will make you a better prompt engineer both of these books um you will understand more about what it takes to communicate from one brain to another or a brain to a machine or a machine to a brain with the written word so uh yeah read these books if if you can't if you came from uh journalism or rhetoric or English or any kind of language discipline or Humanities philosophers are really great at using language so a lot of philosopher philosophy Majors um don't have a problem with with language because they're experts in it already um but if you're coming from math and computer science read these books um and that's it so thanks for watching um I have read all of these books and a whole lot more that whole bookshelf um but these are these are top of mind when it comes to using large language models um today fine-tuning uh and then also um cognitive architectures so have a good one
