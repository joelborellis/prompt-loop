good morning everybody david shapiro here with a quick experiment um so i have talked about meta prompting uh in various places in a couple of my books and on the internet and so what is a meta prompt a meta prompt is a prompt that generates new prompts so in theory with the right prompt you can tell gpt 3 to write its own instructions this is not a new concept there's what's called an infinite state machine where you know older punch card computers would would basically generate its next set of instructions and then you'd recurse through that so this is basically an infinite state machine but for language models or a recursive thing so but the idea so what you can do what i frequently do is i'll have a prompt where it's like you know do something with the following and then i'll do a placeholder and then i'll have like you know output here and then gpt3 you know gpt3 output and then what i'll do is i'll feed this back in here so that's technically recursive but the problem is that the entire structure is is fixed so what i want to do is have it where the output of one prompt is the entire input so just rather than having this placeholder and everything it's just spit out the next thing so what i wanted to do is kind of start with an end point and work backwards because sometimes working backwards is the best way to achieve this so let's say for instance you have the goal of you oops that's not what i meant to do you have the goal of you want to get to this instruction brainstorm a list of ideas to solve climate change okay what kind of prompt would generate that prompt right um so you're basically going to create um well here let's let's let's ask gt3 what kind of instruction might generate or let's say yield the following instruction uh the following uh imperative instruction okay it doesn't understand i didn't think it would um so the idea here is like i want to like write natural write uh you know um given the uh problem write some instructions about how to write about the problem hmm like it's almost like you're you're making a test right um let's see i am making a test and i have to i have to design the instructions for the um essay questions um yeah that might that might work so then like uh let's see write some writing prompts for the following issue climate change prompt okay so we're getting somewhere because then like say for instance you take um like what do you think is causing climate change what do you think we can do to stop climate change because if you take one of those and you just put this directly into gpt3 you can get you can do it okay so what this is some progress where i said like give me a writing prompt like so generate writing prompts ooh maybe that maybe that's the key for metaprompting is you just say give me a writing prompt um okay okay okay i'm making a test and i have to design the instructions for the essay questions write some writing prompts for let's instead of write some write write a writing prompt for the following issue um all right so let's try this again um solving no stopping climate change and then we'll say prompt okay and then you know i i guess the thing is though is like [Music] what if we have a different one so let's see let's try something completely different so like um escaping escape from a deserted deserted island even though you've been stranded on a desert island for weeks you have not given up what do you do okay so let's plug this into gpt 3. then we'll say just add answer so okay so telling gpt3 to generate a writing prompt could be the first step towards towards meta prompting i feel like i'm missing something but i also feel like i'm onto something right like this this is kind of cool um because i almost wanted to do like i want a prompt that writes more writing prompts i'm making a test and i have to design struct instructions for the essay questions write a writing prompt for the following issue um because i i like i want it i want to write a writing prompt that writes even more writing prompts and that the output of that is another is itself another writing prompt i don't know maybe i'm overthinking this maybe i've already solved it and it's just a matter of you do need to add some structure right like where you have a placeholder but i do like the idea that i've come up with something that using this thing where it's give me a writing prompt write a writing prompt and then you can just take that entire output and plug it into gpt3 again [Music] and then of course if you do this if you plug this in it's not a writing prompt anymore like so see it'll end but at least with because i guess i guess maybe i set myself an arbitrary standard where a meta prompt has to generate an endless stream maybe maybe it's not quite an infinite state machine but at least i can say like design a task right give me a writing prompt for how to solve this particular issue let's try something even harder designing and artificial general intelligence okay i was hoping for maybe a little bit more but let's see all right so yeah like um and then i guess you could recurse through and then like say like okay design a writing prompt that handles this um all right i'll call it there because i just had this idea i jotted it down yesterday and i was like let me let me you know uh bookmark that for later so there you have it um the key to um the key to meta prompting is just telling gpt3 to write a writing prompt um so there you go it's pretty uh yeah all right thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider
