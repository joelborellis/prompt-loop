hey everybody david shapiro here um i had an idea so i posted on reddit and also the um the uh open ai forum this idea because people keep asking me um if i will consult and i don't want to consult uh for paid gigs mostly i just want ideas uh that's how i you know solving tough problems is how i learn and uh so i had this idea send me your gpt3 prop or your gpt problems i'll solve them for free and make a youtube video so basically i said okay you know what problems do you want me to solve and this guy storyghost aia said i would be interested in a gpt3 generated actionable feedback or constructive criticism at the stylistic level not spell check or grammar mistakes might use cases for fiction writing but any type of writing would do for instance if the original sentence is he was super in love with her like a lot the ideal gpt3 completion would be something like provide an example that shows the depth of his love instead of just telling the reader also the writing comes across as informal with the word like okay so basically looking for a prose editor or a line editor or copy editor uh so i was like yeah let's do it before i get too far in this video i do have to warn you that um i'm about at my quota uh because i've been making these videos like crazy and i was like where did all this money go um because i was looking at this and it's like okay you know twenty six dollars thirty two dollars forty dollars fifty sixty seventy dollars then i jump up to a hundred and fourteen dollars and then up to 157 so i was like where did i use all this money um turns out the novel writing fine tuning job was a 40 job oops so um i got to cool it off for a week until um the billing cycle ends and i will pick this up in june however in the meantime i wanted to at least show you what i've done so far and unfortunately i didn't document the whole process because i was kind of multitasking um while while coding this up but it is available online if you just go to creative writing coach so our github slash dave shap creative writing coach all of it will be up here um actually let me go ahead and just cd creative writing coach get status get ad um get commit am um ready for plebs to use ha you're all plebs get push okay okay so it's all updated for y'all to use um but let me show you how it works and if you if you want to spend some of your hard-earned tokens please feel free to uh to run this okay so here's the repo uh so where i started was download writing prompts so if you go to this subreddit um r slash writing prompts this is a really great way to get amateur writing oh whoops we don't want it in json format um so our slash writing prompts is someone will give you a writing prompt and then everyone replies with like a short story right and so the top level comment is pretty much always a short story and it's written by someone on the internet so in order to satisfy this idea like rather than use gpd3 to generate synthetic data i was like let's get real world data because human mistakes are going to be very different from gpt3 mistakes you can ask gpt3 to make mistakes but it's going to make the same kind of mistakes over and over again whereas if you crowdsource it and you get you know stuff from different people you're going to get different formats different ideas some people respond with poems short stories story fragments um scenes you know whatever you're going to get a lot more variety so what i did was i wrote this script which was just i copy i bashed a bunch to a bunch of other scripts together so all i did was get top posts so i look for the last month of writing prompts get the top posts download the top level comments for each one and i saved that out to a folder called stories and so i've got 388 stories in here of varying lengths the shortest one i think is a poem yep and then the longest one is 10 kilobytes um so this is uh 10 000 characters long so that's you know that's going to be what about 2 000 words so that's still flash fiction um okay so i downloaded a whole bunch of stories and then what i did was well first i needed to um i forgot to exclude bots and short stuff so what i i went and removed the stuff that we don't want because you don't want to fine tune on bot data um okay so then what i did was i wrote a prompt so here's what the prompt does and i've started splitting it out into more granular steps um so the prompt well here let me just show you what the prompt does i can spend some tokens on this so at least you can see what we're talking about here this prompt does not work on anything other than davinci um curie is not smart enough to provide feedback um okay so let's go grab a story let's get one that's about two kilobytes um because that's a good that's a good like bit of flash fiction okay so this prompt says adopt the persona of a professional creative writing editor read the following story and provide detailed feedback to improve the pros hold the author to the highest literary standards feedback should be open-ended and include examples or suggestions so then story and then i add a little dmarc and then um okay oh what got him style end story provide detailed professional editor feedback with suggestions and examples to improve pros this end has gone through several permutations as i tried it because in some cases it tried to continue the story in other cases it just did all sorts of random stuff but this this prompt seems to be pretty consistent so let me show you what it does and we'll do the feedback up to 500. let's see okay it says it's clear the author of the story is creative and has a good sense of humor however there are some areas that could use some improvement first the story is very short and feels incomplete it's possible the author was going for more concise minimalistic style but in general a more more development a bit more development would be helpful second the story is very light on descriptions readers are given very little information about the characters or setting again this might be a deliberate choice but more description would give the reader a better sense of the world and that the characters inhabit finally the dialogue could use some work in particular the dialogue between the protagonist and the dancer could be more natural and flowing as it stands it feels a little bit stilted and awkward overall this is a fun story with a lot of potential with a bit more development it could be even better um yeah so and since it's a relatively short story let's read it i had seen them all the simpler ones like bombers or shooters whose weapons i could absorb with smooth jazz the scientists who i could convince to lay off their plans by outsmarting them through beethoven bach mozart and the like the crazy teenagers who i talked off of buildings with lincoln park playing not only in my head but in theirs too in many cases the guy who poisoned the water of a town allowing me to listen to the band poisoned for a day that was one of the nicer ones and the more unusual ones the gal who wanted to turn the world into some kind of spaghetti monster forcing me to listen to we we speak americano on repeat the twins who i fought with nothing but duets in my ears you know fight fire with fire the businessman who wanted to buy the whole world stopped a series of seminars podcasts and ted talks on finances um that almost bored me to death i had seen them all in many more nothing could surprise me i thought well i was wrong because while the world's best dancer explains to me their evil plan to make everybody do the twist i realize there is only one way to stop this madness i press play and let the mental image of elevator doors opening uh flood through me and prepare for the ultimate dance off oppa gangnam style okay so yes definitely a sense of humor um the story is short and feels incomplete i agree with that um it it this is kind of a dreamlike sequence and that's okay you know it's possible the author was going for a more concise minimalist style that is a great assessment of the story second the story is very light on description yes this is so this is what's called narrative summary the person is just kind of summarizing you know alluding to things that have happened without providing much detail um but yeah so i would i would agree give a little bit more description and that could make the story much richer and more engaging finally the dialogue could use some work um yeah because there really isn't any um but you know having having a little a little pithy rep rt um would be interesting with the final final encounter uh so yeah i agree with this feedback if this person were to follow this feedback i think it would be a really interesting and more impactful story so there you go there's the prompts that i wrote um let's see so prompt generate completions let's go out um all right so download writing prompts so i downloaded those those are in the stories um and then i wrote prepare the prompt okay so what i've started doing is rather than kind of build everything all in one shot i break it out into smaller and smaller steps so that we can see it all so prepare prompts this is a really short script it runs in less than a second and all it does is read all the stories and fi and backfill the prompts and so if you look here the prompts are each of the stories and it just fills in the blanks so that we can check it before it runs just to make sure it looks right and then provide detailed professional feedback with suggestions in the format of a complete paragraph i actually need to rerun this let me show you how fast it runs because i updated the uh the prompt python prepare prompts and you see it runs in less than a second reload it and all it does is change professional editor feedback with suggestions example to improve pros so um we've gotten that far prepare the prompts and then um i have another folder called completions so i ran a few of them and you can see what they uh so the completion is here um consider opening a story with a strong image of abandoned factory town to set the tone the descriptions of the town towns decline could be more concise there we go a lot of those hard k sounds the story of rusty joe could be elaborated to make it more engaging the ending could be stronger and more unsettling so those those are kind of general feedback um but some of them are still there and so then in order to fully populate that what we're going to need to do is run the generate completions uh script and so this is this is where the rubber meets the road i'm just have a couple of basic functions for opening and saving i have another function for the gpt3 completions and this will actually need to be switched back to davinci o2 i'm not going to run it because i'm going to run out of quota um so i do apologize um but yeah then all it does is it just loads those prompts runs it through the completion and then saves it out to a file and that's that after that all you got to do is run the format json l which it will go through the prompts look for a file and then it will grab that and then pair it with the um with the uh it's commensurate um completions file because they have the same name um so it's just easy you match one to one it'll create the json-l and then there will be a fine-tuned script but again i have spent so much on this that i am going to have to wait until my quota resets um in a week okay so with all that i do apologize i did want to go ahead and get this out because it was a really cool idea um but if anyone else just takes this and runs with it please post results um and uh and let me know um otherwise sit tight and we'll come back to this in a week
