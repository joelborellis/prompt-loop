hey everybody david shapiro here for a uh midnight video um it is three in the morning because this is how my brain works um if i if i wake up and my brain says hey you've got a problem to solve i can't go back to sleep until i solve it um i don't know if it's i don't know what it is but this is this is just how i've become since i started working on this stuff so i had an insight in the last video i was making about uh working memory and task sets and all this fun stuff so to set the stage let's just ask gpt3 to uh define these let's see write a formal academic definition now let's say explanation of working memory oh whoops you probably can't hear me there we go you need the microphone to hear me okay um oh wow this is a big long description okay so we'll go back up to the top working memory is a cognitive system that allows individuals to temporarily store and manipulate information the capacity of working memory is limited and it is thought to play an important role in many cognitive tasks such as reasoning problem solving and comprehension working memory is thought to be composed of two distinct systems the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketch pad that sounds cool visuospatial sketchpad that sounds like a ska band [Laughter] are you ready for the video spatial sketchpad yeah okay sorry this is super unfiltered dave because it's three in the morning um okay the phonological loop is responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of verbal information okay so that's how we that's how we form um that's how i'm planning on speaking to you while the visuospatial sketchpad is responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of visual and spatial information makes sense working memory is believed to be important for many cognitive tasks oh this is just repeating itself for example when solving mathematical problem one must first understand the problem retrieve relevant information from long-term memory and then manipulate this information to arrive at a solution all of these processes likely involve working memory comprehension also likely relies on working memory when reading a text one must be able to remember the information in the text long enough to understand it yes with this is especially true for difficult and technical texts there's evidence that the capacity of working memory is limited etc etc okay so why is this relevant the reason it's relevant is because gpt3 has no working memory um it has only what is called recall or embedding so that means for artificial cognition we need to give it working memory which is what i was working on in another video but what i wanted to do is just create a video just explaining these concepts so that you can better understand like because i'll sometimes say that gpt3 is magical and it's magical because it has 400 lifetimes worth of knowledge embedded in it it is not magical because it doesn't have working memory which is like one of the most basic things of human cognition so if i say it's magical i'm referring to the volume of data that's embedded and the fact that it can just kind of improvise on the fly anywhere but if i say gpt3 is not magical it's because it doesn't have working memory um okay so if we get rid of all that and then we say a formal academic explanation of task set um and we'll put in this in neuroscience just so that way it knows we'll say okay a task set is a collection of related tasks that an individual must perform in order to complete a larger goal in neuroscience oh here i'll let it finish okay in neuroscience a task set is often used to refer to the set of tasks that an individual okay so must complete in a particular experiment or study task set size refers to the number of tasks in a task set task sets with a large number of tasks are more difficult to complete than those with a smaller number of tasks so the video that that reminded me of this was the one about writing a novel with gpt3 so novel writing is is a complex task set because you're doing a whole bunch of stuff at once so when you're writing a novel you are synthesizing prose you're imagining dialogue you're you're actually using theory of mind to simulate other brains for the characters you're keeping track of lore you're keeping track of a plot right so this is why writing novels requires many iterations or revisions is because your brain can only do so much at one time um and but also with writing a novel you we have to we have to simulate these task sets with gpt3 now there's evidence that gpt3 can handle multiple tasks at once but maybe it's just confabulating that because all gbt3 is done is it's trained to um it's trained to copy human text right so it might have the appearance of handling multiple tasks but really it's only doing one task so if you have a if you have a problem in gpt3 that requires a task set that is multiple tasks so this is also called cognitive control i'll add that too let me add that um cognitive control because that's an important concept to understand when breaking down these things um for gpthree okay um here we are the task set size effect is the finding that performance on a task set decreases as the number of tasks increases so that being able to have a larger task set is going to be required for agi right and so by breaking down cognitive tasks into individual discrete tasks and running them in parallel that's going to be one of the ways to achieve agi which is what i'm working on in my current cognitive architecture research this effect is believed to be due to the fact that individuals have limited amounts of attention and working memory see there's that term working memory which are necessary for completing multiple tasks simultaneously the task set effect size has important implications for real world settings such as workplaces where individuals often have to complete multiple tasks simultaneously for example the effect suggests that it is more difficult um yeah okay so it's just repeating itself again that's fine um okay so then let's say cognitive control because this is another super important concept um and i'm gonna try some of my tea it's probably still super hot but you can hear them a little congested okay cognitive control refers to the ability to regulate one's thoughts emotions and behaviors in order to achieve a desired goal so there's that goal thing again so cognitive control is largely mediated by the prefrontal cortex which is why we have forward foreheads rather than sloping foreheads like gorillas is to make room for the prefrontal cortex in our brain this is this is our command center this regulation occurs through the use of higher order cognitive processes such as attention working memory there you go and inhibitory control so inhibition that's one of the primary things that happens in the prefrontal cortex so um cool story is well not cool story so soldiers and people that survive car accidents and other head injuries they often have what's called tbi which is traumatic brain injury which is a microscopic injury to the prefrontal cortex people with tbi often lose the ability to inhibit themselves and so they basically acquire like sort of like a form of tourette's where they can't regulate their emotions i watched the documentary many years ago this is how i learned about it where a guy had he had he had tbi and he lost the ability to to censor himself and so he had gone from like a really like sweet caring person to this like verbally abusive husband and um and he was like i think i think my wife should leave me because i can't stop myself from hurting her now and she didn't want to leave him because she remembered how good he had been so just just to point out like um how how critical in his inhibition is um it towards you know these higher order cognitive processes and and being a good good person this is why impulse control like the marshmallow test is a huge predictor of how well you'll do in life okay side note side tangent done cognitive control is thought to be mediated by a distributed network of brain regions including the prefrontal cortex ah what did i say prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex that's anterior is going to be the front cingulate cortex what does that do i don't remember what that structure does and basal ganglia so that's down here this network is believed to interact with other brain regions such as the limbic system yep so that's the that's the emotional response in order to modulate emotions and influence behavior cognitive control is an important part of everyday life it allows us to set and achieve goals resist temptation and override impulses disruptions to cognitive control can lead to problems with attention decision making and impulse control okay so it basically said everything that i was telling you in my tangent so cognitive control this is going to be a really critical part of agi or artificial cognitive or sorry artificial cognitive entities ace because right now gpt3 just does whatever you tell it and it has no impulse control so that means we need a supervisor that will censor what gpt3 is doing and that's what i've proposed in my core objective functions which is reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding so basically what i'm proposing is that for agi or ace we give it a set of principles that it uses to police itself right because that is what impulse control is it's saying i'm going to make sure that i stick to um that i don't do anything bad right like the guy that i told you about that he he couldn't stop from like cursing out his wife or whatever um you know if if uh the so i actually have a good experiment from earlier in my artificial cognition research where um i called it prompt contamination where i was chatting with my early agi experiment and it thought that i was upset and then it believed it was upset and it started becoming abusive and i'm like wait no you're fine like uh so it couldn't discern the difference between myself and itself and i wasn't even upset i was just asking a question um i guess maybe it could have inferred that i was frustrated because i was asking the same question again and again um but anyways um so like separating self separating itself from myself that's another that's a whole other problem like identity that's the default mode network stuff actually let me add that this is just uh this video is just going default mode network we'll talk about that next um anyways so cognitive control um oh where was i um i lost that train of thought um higher order cognitive processes and inhibition i'll get back to it okay sorry this is like i said this is 3 3 20 in the morning me i need to sort through this because it's really important like i get this signal in my head saying hey hey hey like you know you're playing a video game and you get like a nagging mission objective it's like you should do this you should do this that's what's happening in my brain right now um okay so i'm kind of saying the same stuff over and over again so i'll just move on i think you get the point is that um oh that's what it was gpt3 doesn't have cognitive control we need to give it cognitive control with it with another system and that's one of the things i'm researching okay there we go um default mode network so this is cool so my earlier experiments with raven raven is the name of my agi raven couldn't tell the difference between itself and me and so this actually taught me that in order to achieve agi we're going to need to give it a sense of identity it's going to need to be able to separate itself from the rest of the world so yeah the default mode network is a set of brain regions that are active when a person is not actively engaged in a task the default mode network is sometimes re referred to as the task negative network because brain activities in these regions is typically lower when a person is focused on a task the dmn is thought to be involved in a variety of internal activities such as daydreaming mind wandering and self-referential thought so there it is self-ref like if you're thinking about yourself if you're not doing anything and you're just like who am i that's what i mean some researchers have also suggested that the dmn may be involved in memory consolidation and retrieval could be recent studies have shown that the dmn is highly active in people with depression and anxiety hyper self-awareness this has led some researchers to speculate that dmn may be involved in the development of these disorders it should also be noted that things like meditation and psychedelic therapy or therapy in general um modify the dmn um that is an active area of research so like if you if you do deep meditation or cbt or psychedelic psychotherapy your dmn chain changes um let's see okay tasks that embedding intuition heuristics recall so let's do recall in neuroscience okay recall refers to the neurocognitive process of retrieving information from memory when we recall something we are accessing memories that are stored in our long-term memory oh let's wait for it to finish okay it's actually not done here let me increase the length it says hey buddy we're not done this might be too long okay uh let's see where were we we're access when we recall something we are accessing memories that are stored in our long-term memory so long-term memory is roughly i'm not going to say equivalent but it's approximately similar to embedding in gpt3 so embedding we'll get to that actually gpt3 might not be able to give a good definition of embedding because it's a newer term where it's going to have more neuroscience but anyways bookmark that we'll talk about embedding in a second so basically long-term memory is similar to embedding recall can be prompted by internal or external cues internal cues include things like our current mood or the time of day external cues can be anything from our from our environment that reminds us of something from the past so um this idea of internal and external cueing i talk about this in my book um but basically like your brain is always searching for memphis related memories always completely unconscious all the time recall is a basic cognitive function that is essential for everyday life without the ability to recall memories we would be unable to learn from our past experiences or make plans for the future recall is also important for our mental well-being when we recall happy memories we can boost our mood and increase our satisfaction okay that's uh well here free recall is when we try to remember something without any cues that can be more difficult cued recall this is when we use external cues to help us remember information and serial recall this is when we try and remember a sequence of information such as a list of items okay that's i think that's plenty for that let's do embedding and this is going to be um artificial neural networks so let's see if it can give us a good definition yeah this is just going to give us a definition of of artificial neural networks okay so i'm gonna have to improvise here so when when a fact or task is put is is known by a neural network such as a large language model like gpt3 you say that it's embedded meaning that that information that task that problem is is is in the network somewhere it's a distributed diffuse network of nodes that will activate in order to achieve that particular task so all the text that gpt3 has been trained on that is embedded information but if if there's information that you need that's not embedded you have to put it in the working memory and the working memory is the size of this prompt right and the limit for this for this is 4 000 tokens so 4 000 tokens is probably about like i don't know 16 000 characters maybe they're about i don't know um so but basically four thousand words um so the working memory of gpt3 right now is four thousand words um you can refer to stuff that is embedded so one thing that i learned early on is that if you're trying to do a task you can assume that gbt3 understands what you're talking about like you don't need to define it every time um because obviously i'm just asking it to like define these things so it has you know all these concepts embedded right it has task set embedded it has um prefrontal cortex embedded it has all kinds of stuff embedded so you just need to prompt it to to recall those so remember we just defined recall so gpt3 can instantly recall billions of concepts that's where it's magical it's lack of task set it's lack of working memory that's where it's not magical and we have to compensate for for those deficits with cognitive architectures okay um intuition yeah let's do that intuition so intuition is like is like a combination of recall and and uh and processing at once so let's say intuition in neuroscience the scientific study of intuition is a relatively new field but researchers have already made significant progress in understanding how it works essentially intuition is a form of pattern recognition that allows us to make quick often unconscious uh decisions based on limited information yes so we rapidly so remember recall we we recall something like this one event reminds me of something from my past so i'll just leap to a conclusion and that's also called a heuristic intuition is thought to be mediated by a network of regions in the brain including the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system the prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher level thinking and decision making while the limbic system is responsible for emotional processing together these regions allow us to quickly assess a situation and make a decision based on our previous experiences this is very similar to heuristics studies have shown that intuition is often more accurate than conscious reasoning although it is more likely to lead to errors when the situation is complex or unfamiliar so this is where heuristics come in because the more familiar you are with a problem the more you can rely on your intuition so i for instance if you watch some of my other videos where i'm just like my intuition says you know interact with gpt3 this way it's because i'm drawing on those past experiences i have a lot of knowledge embedded about how to interact with gpt3 i've also got a lot of knowledge embedded about neuroscience which also helps so by basically embedding a lot of facts and patterns then you can you can rely more heavily on recall intuition or heuristics and i apologize my eye's a little dry travesties of waking up and working it stupid early in the morning okay intuition is thought to be particularly useful in situations where we need to make a quick decision such as in an emergency overall intuition is a powerful tool that can help us make better decisions but it is important to be aware of its limitations we should not rely on intuition alone so there's a book called thinking fast and slow which yeah i don't like the book it's super dry and and he yeah but the idea here that stands is that you have different modes of thinking um we should not rely on intuition alone okay etc etc um so intuition uh heuristics not neuristics heuristics so this is basically going to be an identical definition heuristics are mental shortcuts that humans can use to make decisions sounds really familiar doesn't it let's see blah blah blah blah i'm going to cut it off there i'm not going to read that whole thing we often use heuristics when we do not have time to think through all of the options or when we do not have enough information to make a completely informed decision doesn't that sound like intuition heuristics can lead to both good and bad decisions the study of heuristics is important for understanding how humans make decisions heuristics can help us to understand why people sometimes make irrational decisions yes the idea that humans are rational actors that economists love is patently absurd humans we all use shortcuts and so if you've got bad training data as a human you will make bad decisions just like artificial intelligence so in that respect artificial intelligence is just like actual intelligence um heuristics can also help us to design better syst decision-making systems okay so the fact again we're coming back to the fact that um the gbt3 is just impulsive it is 100 instinct it's just saying okay you gave me this task i'm going to spit this out so that means in order to in order to make use of intuition heuristics recall cognitive control we need to build all kinds of systems around a model like gpt3 because it doesn't have any of that so that's why i say like i don't think we're ever going to achieve agi or artificial cognition with a single model um i it there there might be there might be models that we can embed cognitive control later on um but you still need to have recall from other storage systems uh working memories task sets that sort of stuff and so i don't i don't think i don't think that it even makes sense to have a single model because the brain has dedicated structures to handle different kinds of tasks right emotional processing happens in a dedicated model a dedicated region impulse control happens in another dedicated region right visual processing happens in another dedicated region so the fact that the brain is composed of these these fine-tuned parts to borrow a gpt3 term i think that in order to achieve full agi we're going to need a bunch of different models so multi-modal cognition right and then the system that you use to plug those multimodal systems together is where i would that's where i come in as an artificial cognition researcher um okay i'm running out of steam i think we hit all the big ones yeah okay that's it we we hit up we hit them all okay so this has been your impromptu midnight lesson in large language models gpt3 and the neuroscience of artificial general intelligence or artificial cognitive entities thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed and learned something and catch you next time
