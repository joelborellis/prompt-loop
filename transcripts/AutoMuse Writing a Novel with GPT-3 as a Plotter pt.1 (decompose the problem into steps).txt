hey everybody david shapiro here with a new video okay so i'm kind of upregulated because i'm really excited so if i go too fast i'm sorry y'all have been really excited about automuse 3 um and so the premise of auto muse three in case you haven't seen that video yet um it's down here so the idea was that i was going to set up two simulations there was going to be a scene simulation and a character simulation and a world semi or i guess multiple simulations um that works but i realize that i'm thinking about it all wrong so the whole idea behind simulating a world and characters was um that was that came about as a way to test uh maragi which is my cognitive architecture work um but i realized that this that the simulation approach would work really well for open-ended um like sandbox kinds of kind of worlds which would be really good for like um video games so you can have video game characters that you know have a have a sense of agency and kind of have their own ideas however so that's one direction and also i um i don't know anything about making video games so it's going to take a lot of work to hold a text based simulation together i'm am brainstorming stuff there so i'll come back to it but looking at my most popular videos the stuff that y'all really want is um at least that gets the most views in the most hours watched is writing fiction so what i'm going to do is i'm just i'm going to separate out auto muse from the simulation side and to the fiction writing side so one of the goals gold standards is is writing long form fiction that is something that a lot of people want to do and it is very difficult to do and why is it difficult to do well as i said in a previous video it takes us writers literally years worth of work in order to write long form fiction that is how much cognitive labor goes into writing novels so i real that's when i was thinking like okay i'm not thinking about this right so i started i went i had to go for a walk to kind of get my get the gears turning in my head that's why i'm so upregulated and i actually like almost ran back i walked about a mile or two from home and then i was like wait i got it okay so what i do um is in order to break down these cognitive tasks into large language model tasks is called decomposition and there's a there's a paper out there about decomposing tasks with large language models um but it does still at this time generally benefit from having an expert do this decomposition so i was thinking okay there's two primary methods of writing stories one is the pantser method which is it's flying by the seat of your pants and you just sit down and write and see what comes out you don't worry about uh coherency or anything like that and i realized that that's what i was doing with auto muse was it was basically if you create create a good enough simulation and you just simulate a character you simulate a world and you just fly by the seat of your pants um this actually worked up to a certain point so if you watch this video um uh actually no it wasn't this one what was i working on um the uh it was the the one with the dragons the scene simulation right okay so i created a short story here and i realized um it got stuck on repeat but this is a story and i was like wait hold on i did this this is this is pantsing but then i was like okay got stuck on repeat because the story kind of got to a logical conclusion and then it i realized oh this is the this is the problem once you get a premise once you get like the first you know page or two of a story it takes different cognitive tasks to expand it from there um and so that's when i realized like okay so this scene simulation the simulation method is a type of pantsing where you just say okay i'm just gonna set the scene and push play in my brain and write what comes out that's pantsing to a t 100 pantsing so i was like okay well what happens with pantsing pantsing is you start with a premise and you expand on it and that's as far as i got where um if you look at this one the scene simulation um let's see what was it right novel um so i started with this premise here which is just the opening of a story just sit down and start writing and then you expand on it and so you expand on it and then each of those chunks that you created you expand on those and then finally once you get to enough so it's generation and refinement is the cycle for panting so once you generate enough then you start the process of refinement so refinement is is uh solidifying the characters solidifying the plot lines maybe doing some developmental editing like changing the order of operations that is going to be really dang hard um but i realize that it's it's got to be staged so it's like okay um pantsing is really difficult it's really messy so probably won't do that first which is why i was having such a hard time making progress with the scene simulation and the character simulation method i was just like wow this gets so messy so fast but it's a start so basically i've got to this point where you start with a premise and then you do the first tier of expansion but then it requires a different kind of expansion to expand further where you just sit down and write so we'll get back to that what i do as an author is uh well most authors are somewhere in between um so a pure a pure pantser just sits down and writes and then you get to where you stuck you're stuck and then you start over again it's you know revision hell it's about just drafting drafting drafting um and then i tend to be more on the plotter side which is you start with a premise then you figure out your title your theme your setting your characters and your plot and then you generate an outline and then you generate scenes and so this is much more structured which means it lends itself to coding now obviously this is if it's just recursive expansion and refinement that also lends itself to coding but each of those steps is much messier so we'll come back to it and that's what this this loop is here so you basically you you expand your story until you get to a point where you're satisfied and then you refine it you expand refine expand refine expand refine until you end up with a final product so that is the end loop and that's going to be a lot of fun to figure out let me tell you now with with plotter it's not much different once you get to the end it's just that you have a little bit more structure and a little bit more planning and then once you get to because all a novel is is a list of scenes right so then once you get to the list of scenes like you've got all the scenes written out then you just iterate over those and refine them and i say that's all you do it's not quite that simple um but from a high level standpoint that's what it is so um the auto muse 3 slash the scene and character simulation that got to this point so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go i started a new repo called plotter novel writer and all i'm going to try and do is get to here today so one of my most popular videos of all time was the movie script generator where i already generated um 200 premises um sci-fi romance mystery fantasy um so on uh so i copied that and that is here so plotter novel writer so here we go what i'm going to do is i'm just going to try and i'll grab a random premise random premise and then i'll generate title theme setting characters plot um so that's what i'm going to try and do and i'm just going to do like just phase 1 of plotting um today because that's gonna be i mean that's gonna be enough um okay so i'll go you don't need to see me do the baseline of coding this is the introduction so let me get started on this i'll pause it and then we'll come back and i'll show you what i've got okay we're off to a good start so i did a quick um prompt engineering to get a title generator it's not perfect but um uh it's it's it's it's all right so um the righteous view i love that um okay the invasion of the malachim yeah so that's that's that's doing good the iss enterprise versus the malekin all right so we'll copy this and we'll save this as uuid um and then we will do this premise and then we'll cut that out we'll save this as prompt title and so the reason that we're starting here is uh we'll start with title theme setting characters plot that's as far as i'm going to try and get today okay so then we come back here we'll do um from uuid import uuid four okay so i've got as far as this just making um picking picking a random premise so cls let me make this bigger for you properties good grief can you tell how upregulated i am um all right so python plotter the human race has reached a point where we have exhausted all of earth's resources okay so let's plug this in just to see how it handles this so premise and then we'll clear that out perfect title the war for earth kind of generic the war for earth 2.0 colonialism the last stand um okay let's see unique perfect title let's see if that makes it a little bit better the last war for earth okay the last colony alien nation the last battle okay sure fine we can come up with we can fine tune a better better title um in the future but that's fine okay so we'll do unique perfect title pithy catchy and memorable uh so on and so forth all right so then we will say prompt equals open file prompt title.txt dot replace uuid with string uuid 4 and then dot replace premise with the premise and that should be good and then title yes title equals gpt3 completion prompt and then we'll do temp sure equals 1.0 um because if you notice here i turn the temperature up to one but in this function i have it default to 0.7 um so that's fine um all right so we'll get a title and then we will do um well i guess that's fine i can just i can i can store all this let's see i probably yeah we'll do stories so then we'll save it all to um to a directory in here uh let's see so i'll probably just timestamp the stories um yeah okay let me do a little bit more work and then we'll be right back okay so i got the title um so it'll generate a title and then it'll set a story path um and it'll just generate the um make a make a folder for it so i'll have a folder to store everything for that story so it'll be able to run repeatedly so let me just show you real quick what i mean cls python plotter01 uh unexpected argument temperature oh i need to change that to temp okay try it again oh and i probably also need um gpp3 logs there's the premise whenever files incorrect stories mate oh interesting yeah so it added quotation marks um so if we go in here it said the unique perfect title the soul mate connection a journey to love that's actually not too bad um okay so i need to remove quotation marks from the title name all right and this is why you test your kit your your code kiddies okay so story path so we will also do dot replace remove double quote and we'll do with nothing and then we'll also replace we'll replace single quotes just in case um because those don't play nice with file names um yeah there we go uh actually here title we'll go ahead because we don't want we don't want those in the title anyway so we'll put those there all right let's try it again delia is a small town librarian oh i didn't have it output anything but it completed okay so theoretically the librarian and the murder lovely um and then stories librarian and the murder okay cool and then title librarian and the murder perfect um let's see i probably need to remove and and the as well um so it'll be just like librarian murder okay actually no that's fine i'll leave that okay so we can generate a story that way and if there is something if there is a duplicate it will probably bomb um but that's okay because i've got 200 premises okay so next up we need the whoops that come back we need the theme generate a theme all right and so that takes us back up to the playground so i have um here let's give another one all right given the following story write a few sentences about the theme of the story be imaginative and creative title alienation the last battle theme all right let's see if this works theme of the story is the fight for survival the human race is in a desperate battle against the hostile alien force and they are fighting for their very existence the story is about courage and determination of the human spirit this is like your typical catastrophe story and how we will do whatever it takes to survive okay that's um let's see let's do write a paragraph or two um let's see explore universal truths and ideas let's see if we can get a little bit more than this generic boilerplate whatever we're faced with overwhelming odds we must maintain our hope and resolve that's a little bit better let's try that again theme of the story is the fights for survival the story is a testament to the human spirit and our will to survive against all odds okay i mean that's pretty much what this story is about so that's fine so we'll copy this come over here uuid and then we'll do idle premise we'll save this as prompt theme dot text okay and so then we'll come back to plotter01 and so we've got the title here so let's go ahead and do prompt open file and we'll just copy that theme now uuid string theme premise premise and then we also do need to do dot replace title with the title that we generated and so then the uh the theme here theme equals gpt3 completion temperature we'll leave that the same that should be good um yeah okay all right we don't need to do the maker this time so then we'll just do um save file story path plus theme beam all right so it's just a couple steps here and there um so let's test it again oh actually let's output stuff as we as we go so we'll do premise i'll do airline new line and then we'll do print title and title and then we'll do the same for meme okay so now we'll get some output as we go and i don't have to go back into the folders every time premise the crew of the ship the explorer the prisoners of planet x what is this the 50s that's great get some pulp the theme of this story is learning and understanding human aliens are both curious about each other and they learn a lot from each other the aliens learn about the humans in their world and the humans learn about the aliens in their world the theme is also about cooperation and understanding okay cool i love it i love it okay so this is the expansion this is the brainstorming part of the story okay so we're getting some good early success but let's not get too ahead of ourselves um let's go back into um here stories so prisoners of planet x love it love it um all right so next let's consult my diagram um we need a setting okay so describe the settings in great detail um yeah this is going to be this is where it's starting to get a little bit harder so we'll come in here we'll grab the prisoners of planet x so playground um [Music] so let's see given the following story um describe the settings in great detail list the settings um [Music] now instead of describe we'll say uh describe or imagine the settings in great detail um if there are multiple settings list them out and write about them include details such as history culture geography and so on okay so title the prisoners of planet x and then we'll go in here and grab the premise and come here and the theme the theme we generated is this okay oops and then setting all right so let's see what it does very different from earth and the aliens are very different from humans humans are not familiar with the planet and they don't know anything about the aliens the aliens are curious okay so this is very generic um let's see be specific um come up with place names and concrete details okay detailed setting okay well it's not coming up with a name but that's a little bit better so all right i'm probably gonna um gonna go just move on from here because um coming up like inventing um like religions and cultures and place names that's probably going to require fine tuning especially because the instruct series is so kind of generic like this so i'm just going to let this go for now and we're just we're aiming for an mvp okay so we'll do this iuid um let's see we'll do idle premise theme okay and we'll do back up here and we'll do prompt setting uh let's actually write this a little bit different um brainstorm about the settings settings for the following story write a few paragraphs let's see if that's any better because if you use the verb brainstorm it's usually much better the aliens live in the desert in huge glass cities that's interesting huh okay it still didn't write a few paragraphs but that's okay planet x i guess that's the name of it okay made up of skyscrapers and connected by bridges oh this is much better much better okay cool so we'll copy this out and come here okay so brainstorm is good we'll definitely need that when we get to character so let's come here um here i'll pause it you don't need to see me this is just going to be the same thing over and over again okay let's test this to make sure it works python plotter 01 in the dark and rain soaked streets of a nameless city a hard-boiled private detective okay the big sleep i love it uh corrupting influence of power the victim was a politician all right setting the story set in a dark and rain silk city the city is nameless but it is clear that it is a large city um actually that's interesting like if you if you just never name it it's just like yeah okay the victim is a well-connected politician all suspects are powerful people with something to hide okay um yeah it ends up talking about the the characters which i don't like um but uh yeah this is gonna require fine tuning let's just get through it let's see what works and what doesn't and then we'll do fine tuning because fine tuning takes 100 times as much effort as prompt engineering okay so what's next next on the docket is characters okay cool so given all that let's brainstorm a few characters um yep so we'll come in here and say setting okay list names backstories and personalities so we'll do setting and then we'll do brainstorm characters let's see if this works captain james t kirk no that's called plagiarism um [Music] brainstorm original characters i wonder if the prisoners of planet x is is actually the name of a star trek episode let me check real quick okay no it was the fantastic four um anyways so we'll add in brainstorm original characters for the following story so we'll say original unique not used before all right this is definitely going to take yeah even even with a temperature of 1 it's also just like constantly generating james t kirk yep all right oh boy this is definitely gonna require fine tuning that's fine um brainstorm original characters for the following story list names backstories and personalities um it does do a list so that's nice um let's see characters um so then we do title here you don't need to watch this part this is boring boring all right let's run this again see if we get some characters and we're almost done yeah plot so plot will be like just list everything out that happens and again using um using instruct series is not very creative um it was very much yeah okay a space shuttle carrying a team of scientists the survivalist um the planet is located in a remote galaxy atmosphere is toxic and incredibly hot the creature is the only living thing okay characters john the team leader no nonsense type of guy karen david uh the creature okay yeah so we got some we got some characters so that's good that's good that's good um we'll go with that for now again this is just like this is minimum viable product obviously all these names are like um what like not not just like white people names these are white american names um so we're going to need to get a little bit more creative and generative with this and also with in the brainstorming phase um you really want to um see a little bit more creativity so like when you're when you're talking about the setting you really want to expand on on that and kind of come up with unique ideas this like i said this is going to take fine tuning but another thing to think about is okay we take a premise and then we expand on it but then we can expand on each of these right so like well i guess title you don't need to expand on that but theme like you can just write a like write a litany on theme um you can write a whole bunch about settings so i might actually do that where we've got like layer one of the setting and then like let's iterate on it again um in the future versions where you just like let's write a few pages about the setting and then let's write a few pages about each character and then like a few pages of the plot um so it might be like phase one is just get it something on paper oh i've meant to tell you this so there is a rule of thumb in writing which is you cannot edit an empty page so that's why it's just like let's go as fast as possible we'll worry about refinement later because once you've got something that you can edit then you can make it better so it doesn't matter if it's generic if it's boilerplate or whatever because you make it better over time and that's this that's this recursive this iterative loop that we'll get to but um what i'm thinking is that it almost might be that we need to iterate starting here but i also don't want to get too far ahead of myself because reasons uh let's see zoom 100 so whoops that's not what i meant to do make that a little bit bigger okay zoom fit there we go okay so yeah and then we'll just send this to back um order send to back okay make this a slightly different color so it stands out yeah there we go there we go okay so we might need these like iterative loops um so that we can um refine it over time all right i'm getting distracted let's carry on um where was i where was i uh okay so we got characters now the last thing is we need to generate some plot generate some plot all right i'll pause it do a little bit of prompt engineering and we'll be right back okay first first pass of this is uh brainstorm a highly detailed plot outline list all the story beats and sequence and describe each plot element with a few sentences so this one that we were working on where it's just kind of the generic like creature movie the team arrives on the planet and begins to explore that's not a few sentences curse you instruct series model uh they find the creature and are immediately intrigued by it um they begin to study the creature and quickly realize that that it is immune to the conditions of the planet you don't say um they soon discover that the creature is trying to learn about them the team begins to understand the creature and they come to realize that it is intelligent they also realize that the creature is the only living thing on the planet the team begins to feel sympathy for the creature and they decide to help it they find a way to take the creature off the planet and give it a new home okay so there's no reversal there's no um you know like okay this is like this would be a good short story but that's okay because again we generated something we can make it better over time so let's go ahead and copy this out i'll go ahead and pause it you don't need to see me cleaning this up this prompt works good enough and we'll probably call it a day we're already at 30 minutes all right let's go for the final test of the day a small town in japan a young woman is found dead the black feather mystery ooh ooh ooh good the theme of this story is the power of determination okay good the story said in a small town in japan typical uh japanese town climate is temperate okay yeah traditional businesses uh naomi tanaka the sister of the woman that was murdered great that's a lot of characters um and then finally the plot um outline naomi tanaka is a private detective oh the sister okay she teams up with the local journalist hiroshi nakamura um the police are also investigating the case so this is a lot better so it seems it seems like gpt3 the instruct series does a little bit better with um it doesn't like sci-fi as much because this is this is like a real plot um yeah yeah yeah okay so this is this is definitely enough to get started on um one thing that i noticed though is that especially when we do the lists we need to disable um we need to disable this thing that i have here so i'll just go ahead and remove the resub so what what i often do this um just to compress anything so that you you um it removes excess vertical white space um or just excess white space in general but okay we'll call this a day um so let me just show you so um the black feather mystery like this this is legit um yeah let's close all these um yeah so uh we're generating stories i love this i love this okay the black feather mystery the theme got the theme got the setting got the outline got the characters am i missing anything um the title theme set yeah i got all five all right so we start with these five um and i guess the outline that's kind of uh i probably named that wrong anyways so i think tomorrow or whenever i come back to this what we're gonna do is we're gonna loop through this again so we're gonna do this where we try and make each setting or each you know item a little bit better so we'll iterate on the characters the plot the setting might also start doing some fine tuning i'm not sure though because again like you start with something you get something on the page and then let's see how far we can get just with with prompt engineering um because and here's what i mean i'll give you kind of a sneak preview of what i'm thinking um yeah let's start with a theme okay so let's zoom out a little bit um given the following theme um write more about right more let's just write more about it write more about it um expand upon this idea and explore um [Music] the humanity and the philosophy of the scene okay so theme so then we'll do expansion and let's see what it does so you just ask it to iterate on it um so motivated by more than just a desire for justice she wants to understand okay she is determined to find out the truth even if it means going up against powerful forces um okay so it's it's drifting it's kind of talking a little bit more about the character but you know like yeah but they are determined to find out the truth so okay so the theme here is like you want the truth no matter what no matter like you know the the the dangerous part about questions is that they have answers okay so you know it could be better could be worse but this is where i'm going with it all right thanks for watching um tune back in we'll do a little bit more of this work coming up soon we're in the expansion phase brainstorming expansion and then we'll get to the actual writing phase and then the refinement phase um all right yeah i'm excited like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon see you next time
