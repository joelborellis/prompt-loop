good morning everybody david shapiro here with a video we are going to do some dolly tutorials today um i've got a list of some examples to show you um just uh most of these are going to be style tags just to show you kind of how to get what you what you want out of dolly um just to show you some of the styles so the first one is high fantasy art so let's say alvin archer in um a sunny forest high fantasy art so we'll give that um one thing that i found is that less is more um if you look at some of the some of the good ones you kind of you give it just enough to go on and then you let it go um one thing that i found is i often have an idea in my head as to how i want it to look but it often doesn't work so in this case i just said elven archer into sunny forest and it gave me exactly what i asked for i'm going to save these real quick you can take a quick look this one could be legolas this one's good uh and so the fact that i said like high fantasy art um so that tells you that like it's not gonna be a 3d rendering so let me just show you um if you just change 3d change high fantasy art to 3d render otherwise it stays the same you can get very very very different results um so i'll probably just leave it as elven archer and a sunny forest and then change the tags so that way you can kind of see how how it varies depending on just the style tag that you give it oh this is pretty this looks like it could be from skyrim so very different style still overall the same thing it's interesting they're all pointing to the right um oh there we got one pointing to the left um those arrowheads are really big um so yeah just changing it from high fantasy art you can tell that this is like clearly um like it looks like a digital painting and then the the the 3d render um it's not quite fully rendered-ish looking but it's better like especially when you look at the the light um and the grass it's a little bit different um let's see what else did i do um abstract art oh there we go um abstract art like a dream so this will probably be pretty different i know this is boring sorry it seems like it's going slower than it should or maybe i wasn't talking enough oh okay um so when i say like abstract art like a dream you can see that it's it's it's not attempting to be representational as much this is more impressionistic but there's also artifacts that make it so that like you kind of lose meaning but you can still see that the the archer in the middle is kind of obvious that face is a little unsettling um but you see these um oh what is that called uh my mind blanked um but the the like basically the lens flares um [Music] so it kind of makes it a little more disorienting this one is interesting it's more impressionistic you've got this over saturation of the light to show that it is sunny but i mean i could imagine having a memory like this of a dream this one is really interesting there's a lot of motion blur almost you see it's like this you've got this radial motion blur this is really good let me save that one [Music] almost this one almost looks vaguely like highly stylized um eastern um like a like a video game character like from dynasty warriors um this one looks also vaguely like monkish or or marshall but also like you're really losing some definition um very dreamlike love it and so just showing the difference like this one looks a little bit more like one of the renderings so we've got the dreams then we've got the render and then we've got the high fantasy art so you can see you get very very different um results um let's do wide angle wide angle shot well and i'll change it to photo wide angle photo this will probably look like a cosplayer um it's really interesting i'm not sure what the what the background training data of dolly was because um i put in like ghost in the shell and that was really disturbing it does not know what ghost in the shell is so it seems like the training data that they used they were trying to avoid um anything that was like licensed or anything that was like proprietary um so it gave me like a ghost and then like a bulbous robot um okay so we do have a wide angle shot this is you know you see the sun here um but it's oh we we do have some lens flares so that's that's like an artifact from a real thing the trees look very realistic with the branches and and um yeah trees have branches that's real i realize how silly i must sound sometimes okay um but yeah this looks like it could be a photo shoot from cosplay except we have this uncanny valley thing um that's fine okay what was next aerial drone shot so this will so by changing the perspective so it's kind of redundant because if you just say like drone drone shot that's usually enough if you just say aerial that's enough but i found that if you say like aerial drone shot it will it will definitely give you a high angle high angle shot it's a little bit redundant but it doesn't cost anything extra and i found that you get a little bit more consistent of results so you can see again it's still still an elven archer in a forest but now the perspective is very different this is pretty cool yeah so we got the high angle-ness so think about where you want the perspective to be from um so that worked rather well uh let's see speculative art so one thing that i found especially if you're trying to get something that is like not necessarily realistic like i was trying to do a render of um of a friend's book of a character and they're supposed to be like a cat folk like cat person but it just kept giving like a woman with a cat on her shoulders and i'm like no no no like humanoid cat like cat folk and so if you add something like speculative art or or sci-fi or fantasy then it's like oh you want like you know a khajiit um but otherwise it'll try and keep it photorealistic because if you if you have like cat and woman or you know not catwoman but like cat folk in a shot and i'll show you in a second um because it's really funny what it tries to do um in terms of like trying to keep it realistic so speculative art so i really really like speculative art this looks like almost like character concept art um like you could imagine if you're storyboarding you know like some character um designs this actually looks way better this is almost like magic the gathering card oh look at that it's like an elf version of geralt so i really like the speculative art tag style tag it tends to get pretty good results because it's a little bit cleaner right and it's a little bit simpler because you look at this one and it's like okay this is this is something you could easily adapt um there's a lot less noise whereas you go to some of the original one like the high fantasy art and it's not as bad it's not bad but you get like it's just not as clean you see like the hair is kind of messy it almost looks like like it's been sponged or something um so high fantasy art um is good for some things but the speculative art really gives you that that clean clean aesthetic i already showed you 3d render let's do dramatic photo dramatic photo tends to do better with if you want a portrait of someone because it'll give you a nice tight shot um and with it with a neutral background usually but let's see how dramatic photo does um does here um yeah so like i really like the dramatic photo if you want like if you want to describe someone's face um oh that's interesting some of this is not remotely what i was asking for um that's a still life that's fine um okay didn't did not handle this well for some reason it just wants to show me food in the forest that's fine um the dramatic photo is really good so um let's say uh pretty elf with green eyes um and a face tattoo um i'm a big fan of uh dragon age so you can see where i got the inspiration for this so we take out the sunny forest and describe the face and then say dramatic photo um actually no we'll just um we'll just say a pretty woman with green eyes and a face tattoo dramatic photo because this will be more photorealistic and we'll go back to the to the elves in a second so one thing i noticed about dolly is that if you include any sci-fi or fantasy words in it at all the photo realism drops through the floor um so what i'll do is i'll so here oh here we go perfect look at this so dramatic photo um it gives you gives you crazy lighting um it got the green eyes although they're a little unsettling um this one's good uh this one's really good so you see how like it nailed like you you can see pores on her skin right so the it can do close-ups really well um and it's almost photorealistic oh she's imposing um okay so then if you just change one word we'll change pretty woman to pretty elf and you'll see that the photo realism drops through the floor it's gonna it's gonna look more more messy um and that's just i think it's an artifact of the training data because any image that it was trained on that had elf was more likely to be digital art digital painting stuff like that um actually no hmm i was completely wrong um maybe it was because of how simple it was it is still less photorealistic than the other ones but not bad i'm actually impressed um it got the you know pointy ears big big eyes and small face which is pretty typical of an elf um it was missing oh no i guess it's got a tattoo that's either a tattoo or a strand of hair that's fine um okay so i was i was wrong i've i've not had good luck with fantasy characters in the past if it was supposed to be a photo um but maybe it's because i picked elf which is a very common um trope and there's plenty of photo realistic elves out there because of stuff like lord of the rings okay so let's get this back speculative art high quality photo pointillism so pointillism is fun um did i spell it wrong it's got two l's so pointialism if you ever if you've ever seen any of the old naturalist like you know charles darwin drawings of things um pointillism was very common and before photography as a way to document what you saw out in nature and so if you wanted to draw like a representation of a turtle or you know a frog or something you you'd do pointillism as an art style um i think because one it was easy to reproduce in print um like on wood blocks but also i think it was easier to learn um because it doesn't require well i don't know i'm not an artist but pointillism was popular and so you can see this is a this is an easy style to adopt um yeah it worked pretty well pointillism is fun and then what is it called like yukio i'm thinking i'm spelling that wrong okay anyways i'll there's plenty of other art styles out there um so then what i found was that if you give it an artist um you can get some pretty amazing results so elven archer in a summit sunny forest by h.r geiger um so geiger as you might be familiar with um is the guy who was behind the aesthetic of alien um so those really eerie um xenomorphs um also geiger's artwork was uh in part used for um dune actually some of the murals of the worm um so this is interesting because you see some of the like flowing curves and abstractness but it doesn't really look like geiger but it's still a very different style than than the previous renderings oh here you go you see there's more metal um yeah okay there we go so you get the the curves and the metal that's that's got that's channeling some geiger but of course geiger did like aliens and machines and vaguely erotic stuff um so he never really did any elves um let's do soriyama soriyama also did sore amma i think i'm spelling that right sorayama did a lot of like chrome looking robots it's very distinctive art style so we'll see if if it channels that there we go yuki yukio dash e okay that didn't come through at all this doesn't look anything like zoryama's artwork that's fine i didn't expect it would his artwork is a little bit more obscure especially in the west very popular in the anime crowd that almost looks like link a very effeminate well i guess link is effeminate um okay so did not get soriyama that's fine um salvador dali so put in another artist um i did uh if you ask for something that's similar to what an artist might have produced it tends to do pretty well um but if you if you try and like say like do something that's completely off the wall that this artist never would have touched it kind of guesses and the fact that i'm saying like oh there we go this worked really well look at that okay so you see like the the exaggerated legs um and the art style okay so it did it worked pretty well with dolly um the archer is way over here um yeah these almost look like tarot cards this is great okay so that worked pretty well um m.c escher i'm going to skip escher you get the idea about artists so then let's do um company logo let's do a minimalist company logo and i might need to take out the sunny forest bit so like just i can imagine like whatever the company is maybe it's like a fantasy studio and you just want a simple elven archer um as your uh as your logo but let's see oh look at that perfect yeah dolly can't spell it's one of the funny things is like um archer [Laughter] yeah that worked pretty well it gave me gave me a nice clean logo i love it um yeah some of these are pretty good um and then fractal art fractal art is a really so there's a few subreddits um one's called like r slash fractal porn and then there's fractal gifts which are just super trippy but yeah so i just wanted to show you that like elven archer in a sunny forest depending on the tag that you give it you can get completely different results and i think i'll call it here just so that you can you can see there's not a whole lot fractal here although it is very colorful i like it it's pretty get a little bit of a motion blur on this one again i'm not surprised that it's that it's kind of struggling this one this is getting pretty trippy it's struggling because anything where it says like elven archer right you're gonna you're gonna have specific expectations um so you do like um i guess i'll do one more um [Music] rainbow clouds fractal art um so if you give it if if basically what what happens is it's going to be biased towards certain styles um it depending on what the subject matter is so like if you do like photo of a woman they're all going to be kind of like more like portraits right there we go um here we got the fractals um so this doesn't even look like clouds to me but it's pretty pretty darn cool so you see like this is clearly like rainbow cloudy fractal um you know fractal artwork so that worked really well but this last one because it said elven archer in the sunny forest it's like i don't really know how to do that yeah you can imagine how you might want it to look but sometimes the style tags are just not going to work anyways i think this is good for now i hope this was a helpful initial tutorial about how to get different styles out of dolly thanks for watching and stay tuned for later
