you're live okay i am live level check hello let's see how do i share the pop out the chat um aha there we go you all right the internet has been rather off today so we'll see if anyone shows up level check okay down checks level check how does it sound level check how does it sound good good good oh hey got a couple of people coming in all right i know it always takes a minute to get going oh folks thanks for joining had one leave it's okay it happens just getting going just had someone on twitter ask me for a private message so i guess we'll go ahead and get started um so the question oh it's jordan hey jordan um listening but also working okay cool so we'll do a live live live uh entertainment that's fine um i'm not gonna do song and dance um so anyways okay so question from twitter um what's your eta on agi um so eta estimated time of arrival for agi is artificial general intelligence so i'm gonna say that well so first it depends on how you define agi so one popular definition of agi is that uh it's a machine that can do anything that a human can do any intellectual tasks that a human can do um yeah okay i've said on many of my videos that i don't like that i don't like the term agi because it's artificial general and intelligence so it's kind of vague it's kind of squishy to me the goal is to create a thinking machine that can think anything and then intelligence is you just measure how smart it is right because intelligence will go up over time and in humans intelligence is actually often measured by speed um that's why iq tests are timed um it's often about how far you can get and and how fast um okay that was not someone messaging me on one of the many apps let me mute that out sorry about that um so anyways iq which is the you know most famous way of measuring intelligence is more about speed um you know so but then another way that you can measure intelligence is what problems are you capable of solving right but if you set that as the threshold of agi there are many humans that cannot solve certain problems right like you wouldn't want to put me in charge of you know a moon rocket um or a heart surgery right and so when you set the bar as like artificial general intelligence uh it's really vague because it's like okay um let's see isn't intelligence compression i'll get to that good question um so intelligence from from a from a [Music] some some schools of thought think that intelligence is just a form of compression i don't agree um it's about computation but anyways in terms of eta so i think that that you know some of the all the research that's going on i see lots of folks doing um doing similar work to what i'm doing on cognitive architectures et cetera et cetera i think that we're gonna have uh agi within two years now the question is gonna be how fast is it um what problems can it solve and how much does it cost to run so cost to run is gonna be up there because we already have things that can think right there's there's large language models there's multimodal models they can solve problems they can brainstorm they can um they can monitor their own performance if you set up the cognitive architecture right but they're also very expensive to run so those are three things that are gonna you know kind of slow down now to uh to old old zany's question isn't intelligence compression um no short answer no um biologically speaking or in humans intelligence is pattern matching and pattern recognition now you might say that like artificial neural networks are about um are about compressing enough patterns that you can generalize them or something you know because then you end up with patterns and meta patterns right like patterns about patterns and patterns to generate new patterns um and decomposing patterns and generating in increasingly complex patterns but from a neuroscience perspective or a psychological perspective intelligence is not about compression it is about patterns now that being said you could you know argue that compression is just about making a big pattern into a smaller pattern okay sure um you know we can we can we can go with that definition all right so there's a few folks oh well i'm getting many thumbs up thank you folks for whoever is jumping in and giving me thumbs up um yeah so the purpose of this stream is because i've got my third book on ai coming out sorry i'm third there we go i have such small fingers anyways um so the first two um first is natural language cognitive architecture um yeah i know funny i i make fun of myself i have very thick hands because i do climbing and lots of building and stuff but my fingers look really stumpy anyways so natural language cognitive architecture is my first book um this one uh i put this out before fine tuning was available um so fine tuning came out and it kind of nullified a lot of this but the ideas are still there where you've got um interlocking loops shared databases search um there's a lot in here that's still valid and also people say that they like my uh my diagrams so i've got you know diagram of my core objective functions in here and so on um this was a lot of work um and then so then my second book is benevolent by design which is strictly about the control problem so the control problem is how do you prevent ai from getting murdery how do you prevent it from being skynet because here's the thing um if you have ml pipelines and autonomous machines that can think on their own and come up with their own objectives how do you know that you're not going to end up with a machine that is going to change its own objectives it's going to change its operational parameters that is the purpose of this book how do you create a machine that has values that it will keep those values and that is that is the key here which is creating something that that will ultimately believe in the same framework that that you want it to believe in and then my latest book i don't have a paperback copy yet because the paperback copies are mostly for me um so the latest book is symphony of thought i'll actually go ahead and just drop a link to it in the chat so you can download it for free pdf epub docx um let's see did you write anything on the possibility that agi has already been created in another sector of our galaxy um that is a great thought experiment we'll get into that so in the in the comments i don't know if if you can see it whoever's watching whenever um anyways old zany asks um did you write anything on the possibility that agi has already been created in another sector of the galaxy i'll answer that in just a second but first let me finish introducing um symphony of thought so symphony of thought is my third book which is about the principles of artificial cognition and let's see i have another message make sure that folks can get in one second doing a live stream okay that's fine um yes so symphony of thought symphony of thought is about how okay all these different abilities that are outlined in these first two books right they're they're all outlined i've built several prototypes but the thing is when you have a whole bunch of different language models interacting with memory systems and all this stuff it gets real complex real fast um and so but then there's also the how do you approximate human cognition to these machine components because you know we have large language models which is like okay that can generate language great it's an auto complete engine how do you get from an auto complete engine to artificial cognition and that is the point of symphony of thought which is like okay let's decompose all the different aspects of human cognition such as planning brainstorming self-correction error detection agent model i know what i am and i know what i'm capable of i know what my limitations are i know what i know and i know and by extension i know what i don't know um like if you i know a little bit about quantum physics because i've read a few books about it but if you like start throwing theories at me in the math i'll be like i don't know i know that i don't know that um so how do you handle those things that is the purpose of symphony of thought now my background work is what i'm working up to is a fully realized artificial cognitive entity and the the architecture is what i call maragi which is an acronym that means microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence so that's going to be my next project when i get around to it um okay so the question um let's see oh adrian says hello hello we'll listen while working on my dolly composition um so yes um we're doing ai here all day every day um i'll put in i'll put in chat that acronym that i just said maragi equals micro services architecture for robotics and artificial or i know how to spell like problems artificial general intelligence okay so that's that's the ultimate goal is to create a cognitive architecture and here's the underlying philosophy behind how it's going to be stable um so on and so forth okay okay cool we got some more questions coming in so now get to old zany's question because he or she or they had it first um the possibility that agi has already been created in another sector of our galaxy okay so this is one of my favorite topics are we alone in the universe functionally right now we seem to be alone we have telescopes and radios all over the place and we see and hear nothing now we just figured out how to build radios and telescopes so it's entirely possible that they're just not sophisticated enough to see other civilizations out there so that's one possibility another possibility is that they're hiding from us right if they're millions of years more advanced than us then they can just be stealth or whatever or hide you know they can they can out maneuver us right because the thing is is like with just a little bit more technology you know like if you were to drop a uh you know a 60 year old airplane or a 100 year old airplane into a battlefield today it would not have a snowball's chance in hell against a modern jet fighter that's only one century of time difference in technology now imagine you extend that out to you know by several orders of magnitude um you know a million years if if if there is an alien race out there somewhere that has invented agi or anything before us if it's anything more than a hundred years ahead of us we don't have any chance of detecting it or surviving it so the fact that we don't see them means that they could be stealth or avoiding us or they don't exist right those are kind of the two primary possibilities now that being said there also might be physics limitations um so one one thing that a friend of mine many years ago said he's a great scientist um studies cosmology his his profession is material science but he almost got a minor in cosmology anyways one of the things that he pointed out he's like maybe faster than light travel just isn't physically possible and if that's true if it's if if faster than light travel is not possible you know obviously there's stories about ufos that can like teleport or whatever that's possible maybe but maybe it isn't and so if faster than light travel is not possible and we're all limited to say 10 the speed of light that makes the universe really big um and really difficult to get around and so if someone's going to take the time to get somewhere else like to come here from you know even even our stellar neighborhood that's a huge time investment um so if that's the case then we're an island in the middle of nowhere and we might be functionally alone for millions or billions of years so that's that's my take on um on what if agi or something else exists elsewhere now that being said if you wanted to make sure that you're um that your civilization or that your species um or that your biome was going to survive you'd want to put it on a ship that is run by an agi because that agi could outlive your entire species and manage that ship as it spreads across the cosmos which that's like the seat the panspermia or seed ship theory right like maybe life was planted here on earth by something else a billion years ago but that still begs the question where did it come from and why um so okay so there we go we've got that um now uh rory uh and i apologize if i butcher your name it looks irish rory o'connor do you have any thoughts as to the similarity between some psychedelic and meditative states and the videos that are popping up from stable d and dolly does this tell us anything about either great question okay so for a little bit of background if you look up um videos about like dmt experiences or psychedelic experiences there's some great hilarious videos on reddit and youtube and people will try and recreate mystical spiritual and psychedelic experiences this is the reason for all the psychedelic art in the 60s is people had these deeply profound meaningful experiences that they tried to recreate um and and so they you know they do it in sculpture and painting whatever and so now that people have excuse me um now that people have oh here let me just get some water one second now with with uh with um digital art um ai art it's really easy to kind of recreate some of those visualizations so one thing that i noticed very early on and you can um it's it's called deep dream so deep dream was like the first attempt at ai image generation and it's very trippy it is super trippy um it just google it real quick i'll put it in chat um google deep dream um so basically what happens is the way that your optic nerve works is that it starts doing things like edge detection and contrast um hey man got another message maybe someone else trying to join okay no just a buddy of mine um okay anyways so starting from your optic nerve like literally um neural vision starts on the retina optic nerve optical chiasm whereas um that's where the uh your your optic nerves cross so that way you can get bilateral connection and then it all gets projected to your occipital to the back of your head where more processing happens so your optic nerve is not just a wire your optic nerve is actually a deep neural network that begins processing so then what happens when you do things like psychedelics or have disorders or hypoxia or whatever any kind of impaired state that that modifies the behavior of of those receptors it'll modify how you perceive the world and you know in cases like alcohol it it um it subdues it um meaning that it's it's slower um but then there's other things that like accelerate it or modify it and so psychedelics are um very similar to serotonin which is one of the primary neurotransmitters in your head and so what happens with with these is that your the way that your brain represents you're basically saying psychedelic simply decalibrate your model of the world partially we'll get to that um i've watched a lot of videos about what psychedelics do and i also read a book um i recommend you read dmt the spirit molecule very cool um so what happens is the way that your brain represents so remember i said that intelligence is patterns what happens in your optic nerve and your visual processing is that your brain and and this is exactly how it works in in neural networks too in artificial neural networks is that your brain creates more and more abstract representations and those abstract representations are then reassembled based on like square here or you know pattern here and so like if you hold out your hand right you can tell i have four fingers but it's a pattern so what happens is your your your brain or between your optic nerve brain everything else you see okay there's a repeating pattern here and so if you're really high on psychedelic you you you look at a pattern like this and it you can't make sense of it right and it's because your brain sees a pattern but it is incoherent and you can't tell how many fingers you have or something like that and that's why you see um lots of repeating patterns in psychedelic art um and it's because your brain can no longer make sense of it because it's like oh i see a pattern and a pattern and a pattern and then all those patterns just kind of clash and then become like prismatic or whatever so that is um but in the early days of ai art or ai generated images they did the same thing but they were trained on um you know images and image recognition but what would happen is you'd end up with like smaller parts of an image that were like you know like part of your shirt might look like a dog and then you'd have like a lobster over here and then something else over here and it's because that model was trying to identify those patterns and it was misidentifying those patterns and it's very similar to what happens on psychedelics um so well i'm probably i'm i know that i'm oversimplifying but yes that is the link between psychedelics and ai art now now that we have models let's see first i yes they were fractals and so fractals are just patterns right it's a mathematical pattern and so that's why ai art and psychedelic art both feature a lot of fractals because a fractal is a good way to approximate a very very complex pattern and that's why you see all kinds of fractals in nature because you can have a very simple like genetic program that just says like you know like cauliflower and broccoli and flowers they all follow um like uh fractal patterns or fibonacci sequences and it's because those are very they're actually they're patterns they're mathematical mathematically determined patterns um okay so there's that um who are academics working on bringing llms into cognitive architectures uh mathis lichtenberger mostly it's me there's a few other folks out there um the thing is so in terms of people working on cognitive architectures one so here's the thing is there's this there's this fragmentation in the industry because all the people that are still doing chat bots like voice chat bots they're still using um oh what's the name of that script um but they're basically using like uh old-fashioned like dialogues tree scripts and a lot of people in in voice and chat aren't aware of llms yet so there's there's like that group over there that is doing chat and large language models lend themselves to um to chat really well but they haven't figured out how to use it yet and then you've got cognitive architectures which are really old they're used in all kinds of places like rockets um so for instance um uh like every every moon rocket well maybe not moon rockets maybe not battle but more recent rockets um they basically have a kind of of cognitive architecture where they're constantly you know because machines have those big machines have hundreds of thousands of sensors and little tiny controls all over the place and so you basically have a nervous system and then you have it sensing everything that's going on and it creates a hypothesis as to like okay you know i'm veering off course because this nozzle over here is out of whack so let me do a little experiment to try and get back on course and that's why um you know rockets either they fly perfectly straight or they just blow up um i'm getting another beer hold on okay yeah so on the one hand large language models are being used you know there's a million and one startups using large language models cognitive architectures are really old um they're older than a lot of of modern um ai right and so what i've tried to do especially with natural language cognitive architectures is show like hey look you can merge the two um so we'll see what what happens there are more and more people that are developing um more more sophisticated architectural patterns like loops nested loops intersecting loops so yeah there's probably people out there um blender bot by facebook or malmetta that is a very simplified cognitive architecture and they're coming out with more sophisticated models all the time um let's see uh let's see old zaney says i think the potential prospect of humans being the very first species to set off the whole race of who gets to conquer all of reality rather intriguing yes we might be the universal force born now there's another theory that um i like a lot cause when you when you read about physics specifically quantum physics and cosmology you realize that like reality is not what it seems i've got a couple of books um let's see let me show you here's a handful of books so holographic universe this came out in 1992 i believe so this is basically the idea that like okay maybe the whole universe is a hologram which we would call this simulation hypothesis now which i've got that book right here um and then you've got reality is not what it seems this is written by by an actual physicist um this one's written by a video game developer and this was written by a journalist who um i think he was a journalist but he focused on like physics and stuff anyways so you read books like that and then there's another one called grand biocentric design um i've got a grand biocentric design i see it right there and then there's the philosophy of physics which is by princeton university press um perfect pronunciation okay cool uh first day okay i think i'm all caught up um at least mostly caught up um yeah so what is the fundamental nature of reality so i i comically propose shapiro's law which is that all conversations about artificial intelligence are ultimately questions about quantum physics or the fundamental nature of reality so here we are shapiro's law in full effect um when you when you start to ask questions about consciousness intelligence sentience um where did we come from and why why is it that we believe what we do like the when when we have the idea that we can create a machine and these stories are very old so there's a there's a there's a book that my fiance loves it's called gods and robots which talks about how through fiction we have explored our own humanity in the guise of machines since forever um so talos is the uh the the the um was built um out of bronze but as a is a person a fully realized demigod basically so when we as humans imagine that we can create something like ourselves it makes us ask questions about who and what we are what does it mean to be human or alive or conscious or dave or whatever um and so when we ask those questions that so this is a philosophical term that entails it you cannot separate um what it what we are from the fundamental fabric of reality and so we you keep zooming out and you say okay well i'm conscious but you know this cup isn't or is it right maybe it is conscious maybe it because it has uh the ability to interact and and maybe it has an experience so that's pan psychism um but you know right now what's in vogue is materialism i actually put a a post or a poll on twitter materialism is by far the most popular thing um followed by simulation hypothesis actually which of course simulation hypothesis says we're all just running in a simulation but that begs the question who's running the simulation on what hardware and why so that just leaves you with more questions and answers anyways sorry i was getting uh getting distracted the question was oh yeah fundamental nature of reality so you start asking questions about the fundamental yeah old zany is like aha so someone's drinking and it's not me um but yeah so ai conversations always end up they either turn religious which again gods and robots that has been a conversation for literally thousands of years but then when you add in modern cosmology and and quantum physics you end up with with uh more questions like okay where does consciousness come from because here's the thing um one of the one of the most important implications of materialism okay so materialism let me just tell you materialism is very simple it is defined as you say um the only thing that's real is fi is a matter and energy everything every phenomenon in the universe arises from matter and energy that's what materialism says if that's true if materialism is true then our consciousness arises from the matter of our brain and the energy therein but that just means that consciousness is a matter of biochemical calculation which in theory anything with a sufficient amount of biochemical calculation could therefore be conscious and if biochemical calculation is enough to create consciousness then what about silicon based computation could a silicon thing you know could a computer be conscious or a tree or a mushroom or a whole forest right if biochemical biochemical computation is the only thing required for consciousness as you know implied by materialism then anything could be conscious whether or not it's made of organic matter now um there's no like okay so what what gives rise to our subjective experience though like at what point does something go from like you know an inert nail file to something that has eyes and a subjective experience of what it's like to be um and there lies the question uh and this of course became a big big hullabaloo a few months ago when uh that uh when when that google engineer claimed that lambda was sentient and of course like it was designed to model human conversation so of course it said it was sentient like a human is never going to say i am not sentient i mean i could type that into chat but it would be a lie okay let's see let me scroll up because uh some questions have have uh come on all right um for species yes that's what i was on speaking of extraterrestrials there is also the current uap slash ufo phenomenon that congress has been tasked to investigate based on some military footage of unidentified objects yes that keeps coming in cycles though um it almost feels like um you know the us military congress are just like setting the stage to release something later on i don't know um thing is like i think the way that someone said it on one of these press releases was pretty um they said like okay like yes even the air force says that 99.8 of all reports are can be explained by drones airplanes you know natural phenomenon whatever but they they acknowledge that there are you know two percent or point two percent or however many that um cannot be explained um and you know there are more and more pilots and former astronauts and all kinds of people coming forward saying yeah i've seen a whole bunch of stuff that i can't explain and that we were we were told not to ever talk about um but you know they're talking about it so either they're lying um which is always a possibility like you know people want their 15 minutes of fame um so either they're lying they're exaggerating or they're telling the truth in part or in whole but the thing is is it is a leap to go from and as much as i want to believe that there's aliens and super advanced you know god-like entities out there um my rational scientific brain is like okay occam's razor though like there might be a simpler explanation so like um i think it was on the lex friedman podcast he was in he was uh interviewing a major of the air force who had retired but they were saying that they were training off the coast of washington dc and for like eight days or something there were like um there were unidentified aircraft out there or you know unidentified objects um that that they they couldn't explain um and then they went away and they're like okay so he he was talking about it from a military perspective which is okay let's assume that they are military aircraft and that they're spying on us right which is if if you're trained in military intelligence that's what you're going to immediately assume and then you'd be worried because it's like okay someone has drones out here that that or other aircraft that we don't know who put them there and it could have been our own people right like let's just as a thought experiment let's imagine that these are human-made craft of some sort and so there's a whole bunch of drones out there that are watching u.s air force plane pilots do maneuvers who put them there it could be nsa it could be cia it could be adversaries it could be north korea for all we know probably not because they don't have that great of an economy also probably not russia because their economy is the size of texas well less now because of sanctions um but yeah so so who put it there right but you can always reach for a magic answer right and and again this is as much as i love magical explanations my rational brain is like yeah but it would be real embarrassing if you reach for the magic answer and it's something mundane but so the magic answer is there's super advanced aliens out there that are watching us because they're trying to like police us and make sure we don't blow ourselves off the face of the planet there are stories about that so i saw one documentary years ago where a um a general or someone or reportedly saw a video of a um of a ufo like like basically laser the um the warhead out of the tip of a missile and and he was like what what the hell are you doing like and they're like that wasn't us um it's hearsay right it was on probably history channels so who knows if it was real anyways so yeah there's always the possibility of of ufos uaps so on and so forth but it goes back to what is the fundamental nature of reality if the grand biocentric design is true then the universe was in superposition until it found earth in the quantum field the universal um quantum wave function of reality and created earth in order to have conscious life so that's also called the strong anthropic principle which is the observation that the universe seems finely calibrated to create us here um so grand buyer essentially i'll put that in chat um grand biocentric design and or um strong and thorough principle okay so let me go back up got some more questions all right old zany presume we perfectly align agi and we reach a stable utopia q continuum becomes a thing boredom that lasts boredom the last frontier okay so cue continuum is from star trek so the the the q are a race of like the the final evolution of intelligent life basically where they come to understand the universe so well that with the flip of of or the snap of their fingers they can change anything that they want they can go forward backward in time they can modify timelines they can create things they can erase memories whatever they want to do so basically they're they're basically like loki or at least the the one that recurs throughout um the show is basically like loki which is he's kind of a trickster god but he always has a point he always has a moral lesson so the idea the the problem here that old zany is proposing is let's imagine that we create agi it stabilizes humanity and we have life expectancies of of billions of years and this is a thought that has crossed my mind because if we solve aging we solve all medical problems we stabilize the planet you know the sun's going to burn out eventually okay what do we do by then right well if we're that if we're that smart that powerful and we live that long then like we just hop on a cruise ship and go to the next star right because even if it takes four million years to get to the next star we have a life span of billions of years so it's just gonna be a long cruise right but we need novelty right part of part of what makes us human is a need for novelty and we actually also need stress there's an optimal level of stress that we need in order to be happy healthy otherwise our brain starts to deteriorate it literally starts to deteriorate which is one of the reasons that um that the pandemic was so hard because you had a combination of boredom and stress and so like a lot of people myself included have had to recover some gray matter from the pandemic um so yeah what do we do i don't know um there was one work of fiction i think it was it was based on um the the myth of atlantis actually so the myth of atlantis was that there was these like um uh basically fountains of youth but what they said or was rubies or something um what what they said in the story and this might have been a translation of the original but i don't think it was but what they said in the story was that after several hundred years people would get bored of living and just let themselves die so that's actually a possibility is one thing so you think about like bees um my fiance used to be a beekeeper so she has all kinds of stories about bees so what bees do is the older that they get the more dangerous job they take on so the last job a bee takes on in its lifestyle life cycle is foraging it goes further and further from the nest bringing back pollen because there's a good chance it's not going to come back and you don't want the young healthy bees to do that you want the veterans to go out because their wings are shredded they're tired they might get eaten they might get lost they might get caught in a storm but you don't want all your youthful workers to do that you want the young strong ones to defend the hive um that's i think defending the hive is the second thing that they do the first thing that they do because also you want to you care about parasite load so the first thing that they do is they tend to the hive itself they help um i think they care for young and help build the hive because they don't have mites or anything yet and then um and then in the middle of their life they defend the hive because they're still strong um but they're you know they're they've been replaced by a new crop and then the last thing that they do is they go foraging so one thing that i think that that might happen is that as humans age and we get bored we'll probably take on riskier and riskier jobs such as exploring new galaxies right because let's say you go through a wormhole or something there's a good chance that you only come out as atoms on the other side right and it's like well you know i've been around for 10 million years i you know i can take a risk or two the other thing though there's another work of fiction and i can't remember what it was called but it basically said that it's it posited that one thing that humans will do once we live a long time is it will actually become really lazy and complacent and that will will become very risk-averse they will be like no like because the longer you live the more entitled to life that you feel so i don't know which way it's going to go um let's see some rando says on the fundamental nature of reality what do you think about the plank length is reality basically digital uh several orders of magnitude below modern quantum physics and we just have no way of probing anything approaching that scale so that that idea of like the voxel is actually was it in this book or i think it was actually in simulation hypothesis so basically some folks think that plank length and plank time so for anyone who doesn't know plank length and plank time are the smallest what we think of right now as the smallest length of measurable distance and the smallest length of measurable time but everything below that is like uh um stepped or gated or whatever um so the short answer is yes some people think that that plank length and plank's time plank time plank length plank time there we go i said i said it right um those are basically like the fundamental voxels or time steps of the universal simulation i don't know if i agree with that interpretation but it's a possibility again like the smarter you are the more you know the more possibilities you see and the fewer answers you have um that's that's how you know you're doing science right if you end up with more questions and answers um let's see um let's see oh yeah so adrian replied about the ufos saying it's probably just the government agencies to justify their funding it's entirely possible um they might be they might be making stuff up let's see agreed unobserved ufos the closest galactic civilization that makes flying aircraft is obviously us most obviously not guaranteed so i'll say like likely us but there could be others on the other hand probabilistically there could be others right um let's see rory o'connor i'm really interested in translating ai art and video into something that supports more narrative structure what kind of hurdles do we have to overcome before 13 year olds win oscars with laptops that's a great question so as an author actually my first novel is with a professional editor right now i've got about two weeks before i get it and get it back so excited um so the longer a story you create the more cycles it takes to write it so you know a good writer could sit down and hammer out a thousand word or a five hundred to a thousand word flash fiction in an afternoon my novel is ninety four thousand words and i've been working on it for three and a half years the reason that stories take so long to make and take so many cycles and revisions is because you're inventing a whole world and you're also simulating you know i have six povs and then dozens more characters so you have to go through and simulate a whole bunch of other human minds you have to simulate a whole other world you have to do you have to run so many calculations in your head it takes a long time to make sure you do that right but if a computer can run a simulation right we have unreal engine we have um uh blender we have all kinds of other simulation engines that can keep track of all that and if for instance my cognitive architecture work um you know natural language cognitive architecture and maragi come out we can have artificial characters that are fully realized with personalities and belief structures and everything so so step one is you know integrate simulation um not just of worlds but of people right because getting good compelling characters is one of the absolute hardest parts of writing compelling stories if you really love a story so one of my favorite games of all time is uh mass effect and bioware bioware is the company sorry mass effect and dragon age they're both made by bioware and i got my fiance into it um she got she's into dragon age she's reading the books playing all the games it's great um a lot of people love dragon age and or mass effect and it's because of the great characters they're very character-centric stories now there's the great there's the grand epic you know framing you know it's very um like tolkienian um is what's going on in the background but what makes those game what makes people fall in love with those games are the characters um you have these really compelling characters and they clash with each other and they have their own their own um emotions and desires and visions and everything and so getting the ability to simulate hyper-realistic or actually not even hyper-realistic but like um uh dramatic characters that is going to be one of the hardest things to do because you put characters in a simulated world and the story will tell itself right but as as an author as someone creating a story you know you look at um at the biggest movies of of the year right the ones that sell a billion dollars worth of tickets which is usually mcu um well pretty much anything by disney lately because they have learned to churn out billion dollar movies but then you then other things like dune right and so there's a lot of of of philosophy and mythology that goes into good characters and now we can put psychology to it as well um and so but getting those good characters and putting them like you can you can have relatively um trope-ish settings right because like dragon age it's like okay there's a basically a zombie horde um or dragons or demons attacking and it's like okay sure whatever right you know the big bad is a demon nothing particularly compelling about that but the part that's compelling about that story is the characters so simulating really compelling characters is going to be the key thing to first making um ai generated novels and then as soon as we can do that it's going to be a very small step between um you know taking that and then generating images and scenes and dialogue and music but getting the story because again you know 94 000 word novel takes three and a half years there are authors that put 10 years in every novel that they they write and it's because of how much cognitive labor it takes to run that simulation and also there's this thing you have to do where you have to kind of compress a story right because what what happens is as you're drafting a story you end up with scenes and characters that are kind of all over the place and then you have to you have to tighten it up because it then it has to you have to follow like mythic stereotypes um in order to make the story because real life is messy right real life is not linear real life is not neatly wrapped up um but a good story is not realistic like that so that's that's my answer to your question about what what it's going to take for 13 year olds to do these things um okay to do um let's see went from artificial gods to bees i love the evolution yes um who knows maybe maybe hive minds of bees are actually smarter than us there's more bees than humans on the planet um let's see some rando on long-term interstellar missions other stars approach our solar system uh to around 0.5 light years every few hundred thousand to million years um i guess you mean probably in the course of like just drifting around as we orbit um so like i guess what you're saying is like you just chill in one solar system and you wait for another um system to drift nearby and then you kind of hop over so that could be that could be cool um it's almost like life isn't designed for organic creatures or any type of life form to exist for eternity it's like a subtle story that appears and fades away nothing more um yeah what you just said is surprisingly mythic so let me read let me read old zany's message again it's almost like life isn't designed for organic creatures or any type of life form to exist for eternity it's like a subtle story that appears and fades away and nothing more so the natural life cycle for um for most uh for most most character arcs ends in death uh whether it's a figurative death metaphorical death or literal death um a huge part of our stories are about contending with death and learning to accept it as a as a natural part of life so yes let's see if you're bored and then rory o'connor says if you're bored after thousands of years on a generation ship uh delete your memory and live out david shapiro's life or anyone else's for that matter life like the short story the egg or the simulation theory yes um yeah so simulation hypothesis here we're coming back to simulation hypothesis so um if you've ever put on a vr headset you you know that your brain has a lot of willingness to step into a fake reality or virtual reality um there's suspension of disbelief there's plausibility of place there's there's all kinds of things and so you could easily imagine after after putting on a really good vr headset and a good rig like you would just advance that technology by a hundred years and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a virtual reality game and your life in terms of your sensorium so here's the thing i've got another book over there called um the forgetting machine so the forgetting machine talks about how much data will what amongst other things it talks about how much data it takes for all of your sensorium and it's actually a lot less than you might think your eyes um and ears use a lot of compression um and so the amount of data that it takes to simulate your entire experience is a few hundred kilobits a second maybe a few megabits a second we are very low bandwidth machines um if you if you approximate it to um to machine terms now you might say oh well but your eyes are each equivalent to like 8k cameras and that's like several gigabytes a minute no so remember we talked about fractals earlier what you're seeing is a neural representation of what your eyes are taking in your eyes do not record like 8k cameras or 4k cameras your eyes record fractal patterns they're nested fractal patterns they're very complicated fractal patterns but they are just fractals nonetheless so there is a uh the youtube channel two minute papers um so just google like um i think it was two minute papers um two minute papers neural image representation i think that's what it was called but basically you can take like a 50 gigabit um image and compress it into like a 200 kilobit um neural representation so going back to that idea at the very beginning where like isn't intelligence just compression sort of um you know compression of patterns pattern compression okay sure but with neural networks you can approximate pretty much anything um very efficiently and so there is a lot of compression going on um i lost my train of thought oh yeah simulation hypothesis so when you know that that your brain requires very little data in order to be convinced of reality right um then you say like okay well what if what if i literally at the beginning of my life i stepped into a simulator and there was a rick and morty episode about this it's called roy a life well lived oh my god just watch that it is it really hurts so um let's see roy a life well-lit um it it it's basically a comical thought experiment that's like okay you put on you put on a vr simulator and you live through an entire life in a few minutes um and but while you're in that simulation you have forgotten who you were um before and then you come out of the simulation and you're like oh wow cool so um that's basically one one way that the simulation hypothesis could be um could be interpreted is that we're all living in our own um you know self-self-created world out of sheer boredom so but going back to the idea of simulation hypothesis there are two primary reasons that we run simulations one is scientific curiosity and two entertainment so if we do live in a simulation hypothesis or in a simulated world um if we're either here for someone's entertainment maybe our own maybe maybe if we are outside of of this universe we're immortal gods and we're just bored and that's why we subject ourselves to these limited lives of suffering maybe that's why we're doing it maybe we're trying to entertain ourselves maybe we're npc's in a video game who knows um another possibility is that we are um is that we are living out a scientific um experiment so this was um the earliest uh example of this is actually um douglas adams hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy where he posits and this is of course like completely absurd um well maybe uh but basically the point of the earth is to run an experiment to get the answer to life the universe and everything and so that the entire earth it's not simulation really but it's basically saying that the earth is an experiment so if we are an experiment the question then becomes what's the question right and that is that is exactly what uh the answer to life the universe and everything is um in douglas adams hitchhiker's guide is you have to ask the right question so that that begs the question what is the question that we're trying to answer nick bostrom is the guy who wrote the initial simulation hypothesis paper back in 2003 suspects that we might be in in what he called an ancestor stimulation which is that there's the physical reality that ground ground truth there's actually trillions of humans and that they are simulating us maybe individually or maybe collectively because they're trying to to reverse engineer their their ancient past i don't know there's there's any number of ways that you could um interpret uh you know the simulation hypothesis that we're in an experiment and i see another another question on visual compression in lucid dreams to tell that i'm entering a dream dream state is flickering spots of incredible hd starting to sprinkle across my vision meet eyes suck in comparison yes dream study okay so someone else um yeah so here's the thing with dreams now granted there's lots of discussion about where dreams come from because our dreams random signals generated bouncing around in your own head or our dreams signals from from outside of our head right is it is that we're in an altered state of consciousness and we're actually getting messages from morpheus it's possible um but our eyes are not involved in dreams but we still see so how does that work so your eyes are closed your eyes are not not really um i'm dreaming all of you up don't worry uh all is well yeah um [Laughter] it's all just a dream um yeah so with dreaming and and and hallucinations your eyes are not involved but you can still get visual information um so one thing that's really interesting is um if you read about near-death experiences so i read life after life um even people who are blind when they have near-death experiences they can see and even if they were born blind they still get visual information about angels or demons or gods or whatever it is that they see when they're having their near-death experience um and the same is true of people that um were disabled like if they're missing limbs in life then their their their spirit body is complete and fully functional so you could you could easily make the argument oh well you just have a model in your brain of what it's like to have a fully functional body because we evolved to have fully functional bodies so there's some genetic memory in there but another possibility is that we are spirits and our spirit bodies are complete always um okay ancestor civilization seems to be a little uh anthropocentric let's see sorry there's multiple messages coming in ancestor civilization seems to be a little anthropocentric it's possible we are technological civilization maybe the simulations form a near infinite number of civilizations for technological inspiration yeah that's possible so that's another thing what if we're actually being simulated by like octopus people that'd be cool right like what if what if um there's a race of aquatic uh aliens what we would call them aliens and they're trying to come up with the best um genetic and and phenotype for land right because they found another planet but it's land and we're actually our purpose here in this simulation is for them to find the right bodies to use on earth right so they like maybe we are running in a simulation 80 light years from earth or eight maybe eight billion light years from earth because another race saw earth and they said oh we want to go there how do we terraform it what kind of life needs to be on there so maybe all the life that's in our on our planet if we are in the simulation is they're actually trying to predict exactly what organisms and and life forms that they'll need to seed earth correctly and you know you take that out to a logical extension maybe we are on a seed ship right now that is preparing to seed earth with life and we're just the progenitors of that simulation and then old zany says personally i'm rather excited for sex robots we did evolve to be a rather horny species um as one uh i think it was an evolutionary biologist said uh sex is for making babies but that's not why we do it um the implication there is that we do it because it feels good and that's why we eat too right like you don't eat you know you don't ever consciously think like i'm going to eat or i'm going to starve to death unless you're actually starving but we eat because it feels good i made old zany do a uh a spit take you're welcome yeah so everything that we do and i'll tie this back to core objective functions in a second everything we do is we do it because it feels good um so one of the sections in my latest book symphony of thought actually talks about the stages of moral development and so children learn to behave well because they don't like being punished right they escape spankings or being put in time out or whatever so that feels bad right so they escape suffering and they go towards something that feels good which for children being praised and hugged and you know having having you know quality time with parents and siblings and aunts and uncles that feels good and so all of our behavior all of our moral development comes from the carrot and stick of of reward and punishment and that's why some people think that um that reinforcement learning is the way to get to artificial general intelligence i actually used to think that so my work started back in 2009 where i thought that the the right way to approach it was to actually do a combination of evolutionary algorithms that would reshape neural networks over time i did not realize how computationally expensive that would be at first but basically the idea was with the right reward function you would get a machine that would evolve to be smarter it turns out that's maybe how to do it but it would take millions and millions and millions of random generations to do it and i was like yeah i can't run this on a pentium 4 or whatever i had at the time let's see has anyone else messaged on another platform no not yet um check twitter uh yes there could be other civilizations but no way to get to them without a one-way trip yes correct um one-way trip or uh yeah any number of any number of barriers um preventing us from from getting to other folks um let's see okay escape the spanking d shapiro yes um well it depends on what you're into some people would not want to escape the spanking that's what you call a perverse incentive i get it double entendre okay anyways um getting a little bit a little bit mined in the gutter here but yeah so core objective functions so with the core objective functions that i've outlined um it's not like you can't spank a machine god that's another quotable one um you can't you also can't reward a machine unless it's all fake right like you just say oh you give it like a virtual piece of candy for good behavior but any intelligent machine is going to realize that that's that's the method that it works on like okay what what loss function are you going to give to a machine that it's going to actually choose to value right and so then you get into the question like okay there's inner alignment so inner alignment is is the machine solving the problem that you think it's solving mathematically then there's outer alignment so outer alignment is does that machine's objective function or loss function align with the true the truth of of of its external reality right and so inner alignment is you know like okay you're trying to to optimize for whatever loss function is that loss function correct is it actually mathematically you know solving the problem you think it is internally like you know loss function is is this horizontal yes or no like not not horizontal horizontal right that's you know okay are you measuring the right thing because if you're not measuring everything it might end up like this it's horizontal but you wanted it like this right so inner alignment is you know you got to measure all three axes instead of just one or two and so that would be an example of inner alignment but then outer alignment is why the hell do you need a book that's flat and floating right there's no there's no objective value of having that so what you actually need for outer alignment is not how is the book oriented but is it readable right so that is an example of the difference between inner alignment and outer alignment um okay so went down many rabbit holes it's also been an hour so i might call it a day um if there's anyone on chat i see we we we're bouncing between seven and eight folks so if there's any last questions go ahead and ask them now otherwise i'll call it a day and we'll uh well yeah say it's a successful live stream let's see back on our simulation masters so this is some rando um maybe it has less to do with our biology and more to do with the ideas we come up with who knows what any species might come up with um with an alternate history that's a possibility okay so if we are in a simulation and the point is curiosity or scientific curiosity maybe it's not our genes or you know our phenotype that they're trying to figure out maybe it's they're trying to create situations for us to solve problems so what if what if we are actually in a simulation for another species that is facing climate change and that is our purpose maybe our purpose is to solve climate change or something that's going to happen in a million years from now right maybe maybe we're in such a long running simulation maybe it's billions of years right maybe there's a species that is running a simulation to figure out what to do to prevent their sun from burning out or to solve climate change or something so that's that's a great idea um let's see let alone wholly different species operating under the same laws of physics they might literally just be seeking inspiration the first step on the scientific method is the hardest to quantify the hypothesis yeah so um i that actually seems highly plausible because one thing that i have found particularly that gpt3 is really good at is brainstorming ideas so you know if we are in simulation maybe it is just about coming up with ideas or hypotheses in order to test and then of course like okay come up with an idea to test it and then go test it that's actually probably going to be one of the first things that i do when i get a fully functioning meragi working is because what i do is i put it in a text-based simulation and then i run an experiment so right now i just have a a kind of an entertaining comical experiment where moragi sees two men playing chess in central park and then it just kind of watches what they do um but when you have text language is infinitely flexible i could put i could i could create a simulation environment for moragi where it can do anything where it's it's on a spaceship it's on a generation ship i could put it in a world where there's different physics i could put it in a world where it is an all-powerful machine that has to solve climate change and see what it does so we're already very close to running um intelligent machines inside simulation to see what they do so yeah that's actually a great point you know maybe maybe on that line of thought maybe our point maybe our purpose is to create intelligent machines um and find the right objective function for them um that's another possibility if we are living in a simulation let's see okay old zany says i wish you luck you're awesome thank you um ideas might be the most valuable currency this in the simulation multiverse yeah um let's see rory o'connor says a lot of developmental research posits kids shouldn't be rewarded for good behavior but instead learn the intrinsic enjoyment of work is this the same reward system um just longer time horizon um so i'm really conflicted on that because um children do need a lot of things one thing that children need is they need to have a solid self-esteem which comes comes from love being given without any strings attached or unconditional so children need unconditional love which is rewarding now that being said children also do better in the long run if they're given chores so how do you balance that right you know is it a reward versus a punishment because chores are no fun but children who do chores they make more money they're happier they're more resilient against stress and they're smarter right so chores are really good for kids um and but so is boundaries right um teaching a children teaching a child boundaries makes them better citizens makes them better partners all kinds of stuff later on at the same time another thing that makes children very healthy is unconditional love so um i guess the short answer rory is there's no short answer um it's raising children is one of the most complicated things you'll ever do um yeah so but some rando i like your idea like you you put it very concisely um ideas might be the most valuable currency in the simulation multiverse like yeah may i mean you know we're we're thinking machines right we just you can't turn your brain off unless you do lots of drugs or go to sleep or die right if you're awake your brain is doing stuff so like yeah we're built to think so maybe you're right um old zany says i can attest to that my parents never gave me anything um i greatly suffered for a while but i got myself out of my trauma yeah like a lot of us our parents really messed up bad um this is why i'm writing my other book post nihilism there will be um that one's gonna be done in the next month or two as well so i'll have another live stream to talk about post nihilism which talks about abandonment trauma amongst other things um yeah so great questions yeah all right i think i think we're winding down oh wait nope we got someone else self-conscious ai resistance what prompt can you come up to to test for self-awareness in gbt3 um i'll put a pin in that because i'm not going to do prompt engineering this late but you're welcome to jump in the um in the cognitive ai lab discord which will be in the description of this video and we'll be happy to to chat about prompt engineering there so with that i will say thanks everyone for jumping in really great questions as usual and i look forward to talking to everyone later have a good night
