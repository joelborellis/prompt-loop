morning everybody david shapiro here for the final uh fine tuning tutorial video now in the first two videos we generated some synthetic data and then in the second video we augmented that data and we fine-tuned our model um so where we left off was we ran this script to fine tune it and what this script does is it uploaded our file our json l file and then and then kicked off the fine tune job to create our fine tuned model now what that looks like is if you go into the playground and you scroll down you'll have something that's got your name and whatever tag you added plus the date that it was fine-tuned on so here's my fine-tuned model for the plot generator and this is the format that it follows so there's two ways that you can consume the models that you created one you can use them in the playground here but then you can also click view code and it will give you the code to use it and so one thing that you need to pay attention to is don't copy my code because it'll have my model and you don't have access to my model unfortunately openai does not allow us to share models right now there's a lot of reasons for this one is um you know privacy is the is the number one thing because imagine you've got a model that is fine-tuned for um with corporate data or whatever um and another is safety is if you didn't train a model if you don't know what data went into it you have no idea how it's gonna behave so you can't use my models i can't use your models once you train your model you got to come up here and click view code and you can copy this line right here whoops right here to see like okay this is how you tell it which which model to use but anyways so i the data that we created was in this format so if you use just one format in your fine tuning data you have to use that format always now i have other videos namely my question generating one where the input format varies but the output format is the same so that's one one way that um that fine tuning can be really good is if you don't know what structure you're gonna get but you want the same result every time fine tuning is a great way to go um you can use that for resumes for news articles for medical texts whatever so anyways let's uh let's do let's let's do a story so this is this is one of the the pre-made prompts but let's change some of the values so um let's say uh um hard sci-fi uh location mars this is not stuff it was trained on um so then we'll say 20 uh yeah 2810 and then the modifier will be um awe inspiring all right so it has not seen any of these um criteria yet but it was trained on how many samples did i train it on um three uh no that's the prompts the completions i trained it on 202 other examples um uh all over the world and stuff so let's see what kind of of plot it comes up with in the year 2180 mankind has finally achieved the feat of conquering and colonizing mars however the planet here let me zoom out um the planet is harsh and unforgiving and the colony is constantly on the brink of collapse the inhabitants are constantly struggling to survive against the harsh environment every day is a battle for survival one day a group of explorers discovered a long-lost underground facility inside the facility they found a series of strange devices that seem to be completely out of place in the harsh martian environment this is a good plot so far and remember it had not seen hard sci-fi although it saw sci-fi it the location on mars didn't happen the period i did have some samples trained on the distant future and then the modifiers awe-inspiring the explorers activated one of the devices and suddenly the entire marshall martian colony was plunged into darkness that's not good uh the colonists quickly realized that they were not alone on mars somewhere deep below the surface there is a mysterio and mysterious and powerful presence that is now exerting control over the colony that's fun the inhabitants of mars are now faced with the daunting task of battling against this new and unknown threat the plot of the story follows the colonists as they struggle to survive etc etc long lost history in the end the colonists has to fight with everything they have to save the colony from the unknown threat it will be a battle of the test of their strength and endurance they'll finally defeat the unknown threat reclaiming control over the colony the story will be awe-inspiring and gritty elements of survival of elements of survival and horror okay it could give us a little bit more detail about the unknown threat but hey that's still a plot outline it also might not ever show you because that's that's actually a theme that like if you don't actually show you like what is it the thing where you don't actually see the monster it's just implied that it's there that can be really scary okay so let's try a different one let's do um uh historical docudrama and then the location will be um let's do france and the year will be when did the french revolution happen we'll just say french revolution and the modifier will be um will be uh um comedic and lighthearted because the french revolution was anything but comedic and lighthearted so let's see what happens if we kind of give it this twisted into knots the french revolution was a bloody period full of political intrigue and this one we will see the revolution through the eyes of a young woman marie who falls in love with a soldier claude during the war as the war drags on their love for each other goes strong but so does the feeling of discontent from the french people wow it's just going and going and going that's on repeat so this is this is one thing that happens when you fine tune da vinci if you don't use enough samples you'll get repeat um so let's just delete that um and this this is normal i just used 200 samples if you want the repeat to stop you either need to add stop sequences or use more data so i just didn't know when to stop but that's fine gross strong discontent people begin to rise up against the ruling class find themselves caught in the middle of a growing revolution phyllis marie and claude as they navigate navigate the tumultuous times trying to find a way to be together and the country around them is falling apart they must face the realities of war the threat of execution the growing unrest um so there's nothing comedic or light-hearted about this yet that's fine i didn't expect it would be able to do it the film is a light-hearted take on a dark period in history focusing on love oh okay interesting while also exploring the social and political upheaval mix of romance comedy drama and tells a moving uh story of love against the and loss against the backdrop of war um we see them growing unrest okay it's just basically repeating itself so that's fine and again this data was was generated if this was synthetic data and so one thing another thing you can do is if you go through this and kind of look at these you can improve them or you can automatically improve them that'll be a future video where i talk about ways to synthetically improve data other than just deleting bad samples deleting bad samples is quick and easy but there are other things you can do to augment these samples to make them better so anyways there you have it there are a quick recap there are two ways to consume your fine-tuned models once you've got them the first is just to come up here in the playground and you search for the model that you just fine-tuned here and then you can also do view code and you can grab this here that little line of code and that will allow you to use your fine tuned model so there you have it thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon and we will talk next time
