morning everybody david shapiro here um i've got my coffee definitely recommend it for 6 54 in the morning um a bunch of people have asked for a discord server um i've done it before i tried it before but it didn't didn't really catch but it was before my youtube channel so it occurs to me that maybe it's time to try again um so i've got a discord uh brand new server setup um the uh the join link will be in the description um so yeah let me just kind of introduce you to to the to the reason why um this was my most recent video can a machine ever be conscious and it's got like 20 comments granted some of those are my replies but uh there are some really uh really impressive smart people out there and obviously youtube comments are not the best um not the best way to to have these discussions um but i'm learning from y'all i want to hear from y'all so you know yeah if you are interested in joining the discord server jump in um i do have just a few rules so first and foremost is keep it cool and be kind um it's supposed to be chill and positive for everyone um that is number one rule uh well i'll go back over all the reasoning why um let's get through the rules first um number two is discussion not debate uh this isn't reddit um i got all the debating out of my all the internet debating out of my system many years ago i don't do internet debating anymore it doesn't add anything so if you want to have a discussion great we're not here to debate number three agree to disagree so here's the thing is um you can't convince anyone and no one can convince you all you do is share your ideas share what you have and let it go um the other thing is we're going to be pulling people from many different disciplines some people are philosophers some people are machine learning experts there are going to be very very different levels of understanding this rule comes from a previous attempt that i had to have these servers where you know some people are going to be math heavy and then some people are going to be neuroscientists and so like there was one argument that i saw where um someone was saying like oh addiction is just reinforcement learning and i was like no no it's not i understand why you're coming from that angle but you know someone was just getting more and more heated about saying that like addiction is just reinforcement learning and it's like okay well like let's actually look at the the neurobiology of addiction um and you know trauma models of addiction and stuff and they just kind of like short-circuited so it's like agree to disagree you need to understand that that there are different disciplines and no one is an expert in everything and lastly beliefs and evidence share your beliefs and evidence they're yours no one can take them from you respect other people's beliefs and evidence so again when you have a multi-disciplinary team or people coming from different different backgrounds you've like this is the key thing is we're here to learn we're here to collaborate okay so then i got the general channel got the cognitive architecture channel this is one of my primary things that i work on you know different different levels of cognitive architecture obviously these are these are likely to change there might be like um you know fine-tuning channel or whatever philosophy and ethics channel this is a big area of research so this would this would include things like alignment um and then we've got fiction so this will be any flash fiction that's written with gpt3 art for dolly 2 and then business dev because a big thing that i get a lot of questions about is is how to how to handle uh or how to develop business ideas all right so that's that i will post the link to join this channel in the description and i look forward to seeing you all there
