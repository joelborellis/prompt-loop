hey everybody David Shapiro here with episode number three of the AI startup crash course this episode is entitled network network network so first as always I will recommend a book um this is How To Be Yourself by Ellen Hendrickson it is about social anxiety uh this is a critical book for anyone wanting to do startups you need to be good with people I know that a lot of uh fellow Tech folks would rather um rather be a Hermit rather uh you know to kind of be on their own and I will say I am one of those people the pandemic working from home working remotely with the peace and quiet uh absolutely changed my career um it turns out that most of My Success was because I don't do well in offices I don't do well if I have to be around people for a long time however the pandemic proved that everything can be done remotely everything can be done via camera certainly there are some advantages to being in person but at the same time and and don't get me wrong like I can absolutely Ace a meeting in person now um but I've always been good at interviewing but uh yeah anyways kind of rambling and get it going off on tangents point being is you do need to be able to interact with people in person social anxiety is a big barrier work on it but also if you are shy uh then then definitely use the remote okay lesson number one with networking is put your put yourself out there yes it's scary do it anyways um don't make excuses uh if you don't put yourself out there nothing's gonna happen it's as simple as that uh you know you gotta kind of take a leap of faith step outside your comfort zone um this graphic has been around forever um this one came from Pat Wall's blog so I want to give a shout out to that um but basically the the mental model that I use is there's your comfort zone which is what feels safe and good then there's the Learning Zone where you start to step outside of your comfort zone and then if you go too far there's the Panic zone so this mental model is perfect so what you want to do when you're doing a startup is stay in the yellow zone and this is also true I just I'll point out for anyone um and this this applies to any job it also applies to other people that you know so for instance at my day job some a bunch of stuff changed this was a couple years ago a bunch of stuff changed and I was I went straight to the Panic Zone and I sent like a cry for help to uh to my boss and director I was like I don't know what's going on and so they just like talk me through it they're like you know let's keep you oriented and then in the Learning Zone so they know the same model and uh yeah so if you if you sense that someone one's in the Panic Zone you kind of talk them down you can keep them in the Learning Zone but you can also do this with yourself so the key thing is with networking is stay in the Learning Zone and this is true for every aspect of a startup but in particular if you're a tech person and you're new to networking and new to schmoozing stay in the Learning Zone don't stay in the comfort zone and don't go to the Panic Zone your your window of Tolerance might be very narrow in the Learning Zone at first so you'll want to make that window of Tolerance bigger right and what I mean by that is how thick this band is right your comfort zone might be really small so you want to expand your comfort zone and then you also want to expand your Learning Zone and the way that you make your comfort zone bigger is by spending more time in your Learning Zone right and the more time you spend in your Learning Zone the bigger your Learning Zone gets and the bigger your comfort zone gets and what you want to do is eventually shrink the Panic zone so that you can handle everything all right so number one rule for uh networking is ask open-ended questions um whenever someone messages me now uh unless I'm having unless I'm really tired or having a bad day sometimes I'll tell someone like I can't do this right now um but I always just say thanks for reaching out um and then I have a whole bunch of like canned questions that I that are that are go-to's and there's nothing wrong with with having a bunch of go-to stuff uh what are you working on what do you think about AI what did you have in mind uh where do you think this is going that's cool how did you find that so this one that this one is a lot of people especially once you get some recognition people want to want to give you stuff they want to show you things and uh you know your first instinct it might be like oh well I already knew about that right or you know like thanks but no thanks I don't care um but there's a reason that someone wants to share something with you and you don't want to put them down for that you say that's cool thanks for sharing even if you already know it doesn't matter they're reaching out to you so you welcome it you say how did you find that or what do you think of that and so uh or or then once you get a little further on in a conversation hey who do you know that could help me or who do you think is interested can you make any introductions but if someone reaches out to you there was a reason um and and vice versa if you reach out to someone ask a question right make sure that you have a have a point and when and when you're when you're cold calling people or or uh messaging on LinkedIn or whatever um this method has not failed me you ask open-ended questions so like I get connected with with CEOs and startup people and all kinds of people all the time and more often than not so here's here's what I've noticed especially in the day in this age of social media LinkedIn Twitter or so on and so forth people want to make a connection but then more often than not uh like they're willing to talk but they're not going to be the first mover right they're not going to break the ice so these are great Icebreaker questions you get connected to someone you know you send an invite ask a question and the thing is people love talking about what they're passionate about ask them that what are you passionate about right now that's why I say what do you have in mind what do you think um you know how do you feel about this right and these are all good open-ended questions because then they'll give you something and you can react to that and the conversation just goes from there but you know breaking the ice is often the hardest part now if breaking the ice is not the hardest part it's because not everyone is a good communicator it was really interesting um as I became a better Communicator I realized wait hold on I'm actually better at communicating now than other people and I was misinterpreting signals right so communication is a skill it's not I mean there there are some people that kind of like naturally have a Gift of Gab but I guarantee you all of those people who are really good at it they also practiced it right there are actually plenty of actors and TV hosts who are super shy and super introverted but you know what they've done they've practiced the art of communication and so that's that's why I picked this image of a journalist right a journalist deliberately practices the art of interviewing people of communicating asking questions keeping a conversation engaged regardless of the skill level of the person they're interviewing because this is one thing you got to remember is if you if you know if you if you put communication on let's just say a one-dimensional scale everyone is on from zero to a hundred you know somewhere in there a good journalist will be like in the 90s right but then most of the people that they interview are going to be average right they're going to be around 50. and so the journalist has to be the better communicator and just know I'm a good communicator that's why I'm here and by adopting that mindset of saying I'm going to be an expert Communicator so that I can talk to anyone that is the unsung hero of success everywhere um it gives you it gives you more success um in your in your social life right so I go to meetups and I recently went to a new Meetup and I didn't know anyone there and I just like you know I I practiced I practiced practice practice talking to people and then eventually like um you know I had like a little cluster of people around me because um I was so good at you know like asking questions and keeping people engaged and then my fiance and I went to a Christmas party and the same thing happened we got separated which of course if you have social anxiety you're like oh no I got separated from my safe person but we were like on opposite ends of a room and we both had people clustered around us and we just like made eye contact we're like what just happened here and it's because we've been practicing communication skills and people will unconsciously Orient towards you once you are a good communicator and uh you know I would never have thought that I would end up here but I said you know what this is is something that I need to do practice practice it does get easier especially as you build up a repertoire you'll have so many gimmicks and tricks and techniques to fall back on and then things just like magically get easier it's weird like because then people will Orient towards you people will want your opinion people will want to pay attention to you and I and that might make it sound like very like egotistical or even narcissist but uh and we'll get to get I'll make a few more recommendations um about resources to learn because I can't teach you the whole thing right here but you make it about other people right like yes you end up with more attention but like be like Keanu Reeves who deflects attention away from himself and puts it back on other people be like a TV show host or a journalist where it's not about you it's about the person you're talking to um so don't be ego egotistical or Vain about it uh number uh I don't remember which number this is but the next Point keep track and follow up um when you have a small Network it's easy to remember everybody but especially now that I have like a Discord channel uh that's over well it's not mine anymore I handed it off um but over 500 people I've got like seven or eight hundred people on LinkedIn plus thousands of subscribers on YouTube I have like dozens of people talking to me every week I can't remember everyone as much as I wish I could I I can't my brain just can't do that so use tools to keep track of conversations right now I use the primary tools I use are LinkedIn and Trello because LinkedIn they have a good little you know message thing and so you can just scroll through um and I think LinkedIn allows you to put notes beside someone or maybe that's a paid feature I don't remember um anyways uh I probably need to upgrade my LinkedIn um account anyways because I use it so much um and then Trello which is offline so I can make notes of who to follow up with and why and when calendly um I forgot to add this one so calendly allows you to just send someone a link and then they can schedule a call with you later on that is so much easier um uh than than trying to manually negotiate I'm like here let's talk and I just send them a link um another thing to keep in keep in mind remember I said that people will reach out um they'll like make a connection but then they won't be the first to Flinch they won't break the ice uh the same is true for following up there might be dozens of people who are willing to talk to you again but they're not going to be the one to initiate so you have to be the one to initiate and when you initiate so sometimes if you follow me on LinkedIn Twitter or YouTube sometimes I'll put out an all call right I'll say I'll just like you know here here's a beacon like someone reach out if you want to talk to me um remember people are shy right um and so they might they might like connect with me on LinkedIn but then they're not going to say anything and so what you have to do is you have to be targeted um and you say you I want to talk to you um and that makes one that makes people feel really good because it's like you know you know you notice me you value me you want to talk to me for some reason and 90 of people are receptive to that um even if it's for a brief chat uh so yeah keep track and follow up this is critical um and like it's it's also a habit so when when when I first almost exactly a year ago I was talking to a buddy of mine who had uh the previous year made a New Year's resolution of he wanted to get famous and and networking was one of the things that he said that he was good at and I was like man I'm never going to get good at that it's so tedious Here I Am A year later because I said I I was a year behind him I said you know what I want to do that I want to have the same goal my New Year's resolution a year ago was um I wanted to get famous too and here I am I'm working on it um but yeah so keep track follow up Reach Out break the ice um people are so willing to talk and like I said people love talking about what they're passionate about um it's like it's it's this like unspoken truth and you just you push that button my fiance taught me this so you find what someone's passionate about and you keep pushing that button right you know if you play uh if you play any video games where you've got a dialogue tree like and there's the there's the dialog option that has the little star like you know in the little heart beside it like this is the person's favorite topic keep spamming that that favorite topic button it works so well that's how she seduced me actually and then she taught me the the secret and it works really well um all right so a resource that I want to recommend is charisma on command so there is the the social anxiety book that I that I told you about which is about kind of unpacking what's going on with approach anxiety and stuff like that but then once you get over that it's like okay now what do you do um I found that Charisma on command is a phenomenal YouTube channel um and I watch it like I try and watch a few videos every week and one thing that's really weird or first I'll tell you why it's good first they give you examples they take interviews and movies like so they take real world examples they also take fictional examples um they deconstruct it they explain what's going on they explain why and they give you tips the whole way it's kind of like how all the all when I'm when I'm coding and and you watch my tutorials and I'm like oh this is why I did this this is how I'm thinking about it they do that but for social situations they completely deconstruct it and it's it's weird it's almost magical when I when I need some of these lessons they just pop up and I know exactly how to handle it um and you know just accumulate a a toolbox of of social techniques in order to uh have more presence more Charisma to pay attention to people and it really works I believe that's it okay yes so this has been episode three network network network um thanks for watching and we'll uh be in touch soon
