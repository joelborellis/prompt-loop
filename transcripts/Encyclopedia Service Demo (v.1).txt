hey everybody david shapiro here with another video about raven in this video i wanted to demonstrate the encyclopedia service now the encyclopedia service is meant to give raven factual information about the world right now the encyclopedia service is based on wikipedia and of course wikipedia is not the absolute best source of information but it's good enough for now so i want to show you i've got the the nexus running and it's running right here nexus context output microservices um it's got this is the this is the context that i gave it bacon is tasty bacon is good i like bacon do you like bacon bacon is made from pigs dogs definitely like bacon so obviously a key word here is bacon so i'm testing a few things here in the the encyclopedia service what it does is it'll look for context and then once it finds a context it will it will look for keywords in that context and it will use that keyword those keywords to search its encyclopedia database and then once it searches that database it will add those articles to the stream of consciousness to the nexus so that it can then be used for context augmentation or question answering so let me go ahead and start the encyclopedia service and you can see it found a whole bunch of stuff and injected it so let's go ahead and stop the service and go back to nexus whoa holy mackerel look at this so what it did was it oh interesting i need to fix that um it injected it as a list but what we did was uh here let me go back here so you see scroll back up a little bit this is some of the debug stuff that i've got uh let's see where was it keywords where are the keywords here we go um to do so these are the keywords that it found dogs definitely like bacon i like bacon or just like bacon and then bacon okay so it tuned in and said bacon so search for each of these terms obviously there's no wikipedia article entries called dogs definitely like bacon or like bacon however there are wikipedia articles entitled bacon uh and so this is what it found we got francis bacon uh philadelphia looks like this actually probably had some bad formatting let's see image bacon from a back so it actually got the article for bacon looks like turkey bacon and chicken bacon the bacon number of an actor so it got kevin bacon coat of arms la kanye uh probably someone in france um so yeah this is this obviously needs a little bit of work uh roger bacon i i should include the title i need to fix a bun a bunch of stuff oh look i got the uh the baconator double the baconator sandwich uh so if you mention bacon to raven raven will automatically pull all of these articles uh and yeah so looking at this closely i definitely have some work to do because it still has some some wonky formatting but bacon county southeast part of the united states of georgia so this gives raven very explicit knowledge about the world and with through context raven can can filter this out and again this is a minimum viable product in the future the the encyclopedia service will use semantic understanding so that it will only recall uh articles that are that are like this is clearly food right bacon is made from pigs dogs like bacon so we're looking for food bacon um not kevin bacon or roger bacon or or bacon county so uh yeah there you have it there's the demonstration of the encyclopedia service this is the very first version so uh ever onwards and upwards i've got a lot of work to do to improve it but here's the here's the proof of concept thanks for watching
