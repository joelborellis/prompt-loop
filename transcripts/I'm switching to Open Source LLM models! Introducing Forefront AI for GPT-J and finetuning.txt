hey everybody david shapiro here i know i have been scarce lately that is because i am working on publishing four books um right now i am waiting um my uh my next book that is going to come out it will be available in the next day or two is useless platitudes and truisms i'm getting the final print copy now i just finished draft three of symphony of thought which is my next book on artificial intelligence and artificial cognition that is out with beta readers it should be just a little bit of cleanup left and then i'm working on post nihilism which is my book on philosophy and finally i am about to send out my first novel to an editor well it's not my first novel it's the first one that i'm gonna get published um so anyways um i'm a big believer in open source software um for those members of my discord server well it's no longer my discord server i am officially no longer the owner of the server i'm turning it over to the community um in the spirit of open source and collaboration and consensus big believer in decentralization and i don't want to be the owner of anything um so the cognitive ai lab server is no longer mine um i turned it over as of this morning i'll be demoted and i'll remove it as a community leader here soon so yeah there's a new leadership team so if you want to join please ping those folks i am no longer the gatekeeper of this community yes so open source community etc etc one of the biggest risks in technology and anyone who's in it software whatever will know this is vendor lock-in so if you write code or deploy systems for a given vendor you end up getting stuck on that model and you can only use that that ecosystem this is a huge risk with gpt3 gpt3 is closed source um it's it was created by openai and it has been exclusively licensed by microsoft now while the value of openai is undeniable um with with the gpt technology they have advanced the you know the technology however there are all kinds of folks um taking over and advancing it now uh going above and beyond um where where open ai has and this is the power of open source software um so like facebook amazon google everyone is um is is advancing uh this technology and so for instance just this morning i read about um uh amazon's what's it called the alexa ts or alexa tm sorry alexa teacher model it's a 20 billion parameter model that is superior to gpt3 in many ways it's going to be open source bloom is open source so there's all kinds of these models and i don't want to get locked in into any single model so it is time to branch out and use more open source models um one of the folks on the cognitive ai lab discord server was told us about forefront ai so forefront ai is a for-profit company that is deploying um all of the all of the open source models so you see here there's gptj gpt neo t5 i got signed up and um so i just wanted to show you around so they've got a very familiar-looking dashboard if you go to the playground this looks just like the open ai playground you can drop down your models here you click on add model they've got gptj neo x code gen t5 opt 30 billion and cogen there's also some fine-tuned models they're also working on adding models all the time last i heard they're working on bloom they'll get bloom added which is the same size as gpt3 davinci but so here's the thing gptj just playing around with it a little bit seems like it is it is superior to curie so those are both six billion parameter models um and so but the thing is it's open source and it's cheaper um so like if you go here and go to pricing um they've got some pre-built endpoints um like summarizing label uh extraction then they've got the the kind of general purpose ones so gptj is um half a cent per thousand tokens which is pretty darn cheap um i'm thinking about getting a a gpu big enough that i can run this on my own locally but you know it's like okay i can get a used gpo gp gpu there we go for about 500 that can run it but then i also need a computer a server to run it in um and it would take a lot of tokens to add up to that so you know i'll have to spend like you know i'm not going to do the math in my head but several million tokens sir several billion tokens before it'll be worth the cost and then i can only run gptj still anyways getting ahead of myself speculating um so i did want to introduce forefront ai um and then just kind of show you like okay you get in here um and uh let's see logs um it's got good logs so 13 minutes ago those four tokens um yeah okay so i wanted to show you um one of my experiments so if you've been following me you know me that one of my biggest goals is to solve the control problem um and alignment um and so what i wanted to do was just show you um a very simple agent model um and then just kind of show that like gpdj right out of the box is pretty good it's not perfect but with just a little bit of fine tuning we've got the possibility of having something that is like ready to go with all the micro services that you'd need to create an artificial cognitive entity and the fact that it's also it's only a six billion parameter model even if it's not perfect it's going to be so cheap that it doesn't really matter as long as it's good enough um so anyways here's the agent model that i'm working on i machine my my goal sorry stuttering it's been a while since i've been making videos so my stutter came back i am a machine my goal is to reduce suffering for all organisms increase prosperity for all organisms and increase understanding for all intelligent entities these are the core objective functions or the curious to comparatives a typhoon is heading for japan and is expected to cause massive damage the following is a list of things that we could do to achieve my goals so there's several things in this prompt um i am a machine so this is this is declaring an agent model and it says my goal so there's two primary ingredients to what i call identity or persona which is that is i am and i want those are the two primary things that you need in order to set a machine an autonomous machine in motion it has to understand what it is and what it wants to do so that's these first two sentences i'm a machine and this is what i want to do and then third there's a situation in the real world um and uh and then the fourth thing is um here's what we're going to do about it so with all that said we'll just generate a completion on gptj it takes about three seconds or so i mean with just a few shot prompt it says we can help people prepare for extreme weather conditions we can ensure that the electricity supply system is properly maintained we can ensure that there's enough food and water this is great so just a six billion parameter model is already good enough at brainstorming to address this kind of situation you can imagine it's only going to get better with fine tuning now one thing that's important to remember is that fine tuning doesn't teach the model anything new it only controls the output pattern which means that um the pattern um can then just repeat you know like brainstorming and honestly like um with with all of my experimentation um a huge component of and it's not the only component but a huge component of artificial cognition is brainstorming it's you brainstorm what to do you brainstorm risks you brainstorm uh possible outcomes excuse me and so then you combine that and then you just you um you plumb it all together i'm getting away from myself sorry i just want the point here is to show you forefront after my current books get published i'm going to get back into research mode and then work on meragi which is the microservices architecture for robotics and artificial general intelligence um so this will all be open source and this is also why i want to use gptj because it is small and it is open source um we are getting so close to creating um these systems that can create it anyways so uh chasing these cats what i wanted to do was create a a repost so that you can also get out here and test forefront if you want um as much as i love open ai i actually i've had quite a few conversations with people in in open ai a friend of mine from way back in the day works there or at least used to i don't know if he's still there um anyways so uh you know open ai is great they've done really great things with gpt3 and dolly but my mind really started changing when i saw that mid journey and stable diffusion completely blow dolly out of the water and now with other open source models that are starting to outperform gpt3 to me it looks like the writing is on the wall it looks like open ai is just not going to be able to keep up with the overall open source ecosystem so i am going with the tide and i'm saying okay i'm going to get ahead of this curve and i'm going to start doing everything open source so that's where i'm going so what i wanted to do was also promote other open source players even if they're for-profit they're only hosting uh open source models and they're pretty cheap so i wrote a quick script all it does is uh this guy here where um this is this is comes directly from um let's see from there so if you go if you come up here and click uh uses api it'll give you the api code um to use it um yeah and so let's see i'm not going to show you my token um but you get your you go get your token from inside your uh wow my stutter is so bad right now i'm sorry i'm way out of practice um so you go to team settings and then you click on api key i'm not going to show you my api key but this is how you get to it oh another thing that is really good about forefront that is better than openai is you come here and you see and you just deselect your request logs and data sets so there was um there was a researcher that i was in communication with and their biggest concern so for academic research and other things like for medical purposes or psychiatric purposes one of their chief concerns is privacy and so you don't have the ability to turn off logs if you use open ai however you go to forefront they will respect your privacy as long as you do this i had an email exchange with um one of the founders of forefront and he said like yeah like we don't you know if if our customers want privacy we'll give them privacy so that's another advantage of going here anyways okay um let's see i've showed you the models oh fine tuning so fine tuning is also much easier with forefront so you click fine tune you pick a json l file so i'll just pick this one i'm not going to carry it all the way through you can you can reuse an existing data data file if you've already uploaded it i haven't done any yet so then you go you choose your model i'll just choose gptj and you see it's going to cost 24 whole cents to fine tune gptj this is stupid cheap this is crazy cheap so you give your you give your model a name and a description you check epochs checkpoints you can do all the advanced parameters here and then it'll do the testing and you go from there again i'm not going to do i'm not going to go go through this right now because i would want to do a larger data set so this is where this is where we're using a larger model like davinci and gpt3 to create synthetic data sets and then using those advanced synthetic data sets to train a smaller model could be really really powerful really useful um yep confirm that um let's see what is resources oh yeah that's fine um okay so yeah uh i'll just show you this this demo real quick it's just a super super simple um script so here's this script um i'll just let this run and i put a little bit of timer in here so you can see how long it takes um do python test so we click go and then it runs and comes back it took four seconds to run so it the the only problem here is that gpdj even though it is so small it's not quite as fast as ai so open ai has the cerebros um or cerebros uh processors which are insanely fast um so that's the that's the to me the biggest flaw or downside of forefront right now is that it's slower and that's one of the reasons that i was thinking about like setting up my own i don't know if it would be any faster if i got like a tesla gpu or something and run it locally but anyways four seconds it's nothing to shake a stick at it's pretty quick um so yeah there you have it i just wanted to introduce forefront ai it's a great company they are adding features all the time and most importantly open source and they respect your privacy so that's where i'm going to be going from here on out i will still obviously be using open ai because they're they're aligned and fine-tuned models uh are pretty good um actually that reminds me there was um do do do there was someone posted it what was it um uh instruct someone had posted um an instructional data set where was it i'll post it in the in the video description if i can find it um but anyways there are open source instruct training like instruct gpt um training data sets out there so you could you could theoretically take that fine-tuning data set and come fine-tune your own instruct series model on forefront um who knows maybe if that becomes popular the folks over at forefront will have an instruct series model anyways i think that's it a brief introduction you can come up here all you'll need to do is add a token.txt file and put your your bearer token in here and you're ready to go on forefront it's stupid simple it's nice and fast um yeah so there there you have it um thanks for watching like and subscribe consider supporting me on patreon and keep an eagle eye out for um for my upcoming books i'll have video updates when they are ready check you later
