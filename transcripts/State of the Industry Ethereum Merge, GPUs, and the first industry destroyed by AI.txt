morning everybody David Shapiro here with your daily state of the industry address okay so this is going to be a doozy there's a lot going into this so what am I talking about I'm talking about gpus and AI art and large language models that is kind of you know that's my schtick but got to zoom out Take the Long View take the take the take the macro View so some folks are worried that China will invade Taiwan and what does this have to do with anything well part of the price of gpus is supply chain but also where chips are made so if China invades Taiwan then there's likely to be a large disruption to chip manufacturers um now that doesn't mean that gpus are going to be affected but other chips might be etc etc so some good news here the Pentagon says that China will not invade Taiwan in the next two years so we've got to reprieve their if it's accurate who knows um the U.S Department of Defense puts a lot of attention on China um there is they they publish a a a military report every year about China's capabilities and what they expect is Gonna China is going to be able to do and I read that every now and then um anyways so no disruption there hopefully cross your fingers um still there is some cold war escalation happening U.S bars Advanced Tech firms and this is only federally funded it's not all Tech firms from building China factories for 10 years so clearly something is going on behind the scenes in terms of what the U.S expects um China to do um I I saw in in the immediate aftermath of this some people uh suspect that this could backfire because it'll Force China to build their own AI chip tech companies and then they might do it better than us who knows um and similar news uh U.S officials order Nvidia to Halt sales to top of uh top AI chips to China it's all in the same same bar right um so who knows what's going on but in the long run hopefully one of the results of this is that um we're less dependent on a single source of chips such as Taiwan um and then we also have more access to GPU and other AI Hardware because one of the biggest constraints right now in our field ours being large language models and Transformers in general is access to Affordable Hardware in order to run these things um so another thing that could help this is uh ethereum has switched has completed the merge which they're going from proof of work to proof of stake I'll post a link if you want to understand that a little bit better but the short version is that GPU mining is kaput for ethereum now obviously ethereum is not the only cryptocurrency but it is the largest and this move comes in the wake of a lot of uh States and Nations and cities just flat out Banning cryptocurrency mining um and like there have been uh cases where there's just like racks and racks and racks of used gpus for sale because suddenly the demand for the gpus is gone now this makes sense from a uh from an environmental policy standpoint because um the amount of power being consumed for cryptocurrency mining was ludicrous um so that's just it was an irresponsible decision to make Bitcoin and ethereum and all these things require just tremendous amounts of juice to mine um so I definitely agree with this but also what it will do is it will allow the market to correct and allow gpus to be bought and used for things that gpus ought to be bought for and used for such as actual gaming if you're a gamer there's a while where like you know every time Nvidia came out with a new um GPU they were all bought up within literally within seconds of hitting like um Newegg and eBay and whatever else and they were being bought by um by Bots actually and the prices were being bit up to double and triple their their market value so that was absurd and it was frustrating but now you can actually get gpus just walk into your you know your local computer store and buy one off the shelf because they're no longer just you know the supply chain is is is being fixed um so why am I bringing this up though Bloom is the latest open source uh model and it is roughly equivalent to gpt3 um 176 billion parameters um and let's see it takes depending on how you deploy it it takes 768 gigabytes of GPU Ram or 352 at half Precision I'm wondering if people do the um distill it down to end eight if you could cut that in half again and get it down to what's that 175 gig of RAM that's still a lot bigger than than any of us can afford right now but with with um uh ongoing refinement and also availability of more data center grade gpus so here's the thing you know I've got a I've got an Nvidia RTX 2070 in my computer it's getting old but it's big enough you know it's got eight gig of RAM it's big enough to run some smaller models um but you know maybe in a year or two if I keep this up um I'll be able to get you know something a little bit bigger or a pair of things that are a little bit bigger and I'll be able to run something like Neo X locally so Neo X it looks like for inference um this this helpful blog says that Neo X took about 40 gigabytes across two gpus so that's you know you get two 24 gig gpus which that's going to be within reach soon um we can start running these at full bore locally without having to pay um for uh for apis um which that's going to do a lot for security so one of the biggest things um and I did see that that Microsoft azure if you use if you use large language models on Azure they are actually HIPAA compliant that is a big concern that a lot of people have so um when I when I tested out Forefront they have a very simple ability to just turn off logging right but that does just because you can turn off logging does not mean that it is like HIPAA compliant or part 11 compliant or compliant with any other privacy uh regulations um still it's a step in the right direction so getting certified in in all those all those compliances um like ISO 27k um all those all those fun things that's going to be a big thing now having worked in technology for a long time I will say that if you own the data if the data stays on-prem and doesn't ever go up to another vendor it is a lot easier to get certified for privacy and security Now that means that you have responsibility to keep that data secure and private but there's other you know there's if you're a publicly traded company there's sarbanes-oxley there's lots of companies that do socks auditing just because it is a good standard to have there's a surprising number of private companies that are not required to do sarbanes-oxley auditing that do it anyways anyways so the just taking a tangent thinking about this from a business perspective um the combination of end 8 distillation and and uh hopefully a surplus of good GPU Hardware means that we'll be able to start running some of these locally you know um building local inference servers before too long obviously you know something as big and powerful as Bloom um even if it's 170 175 gigabytes of RAM um so what's that that's about 24 per GPU so that's four so that's still eight 24 gigabyte gpus um so that's still going to be pricey um I think that's probably what if you get used it's still probably about 10 grand right now um but that's going to be state of the art uh open source model now you won't have enough to fine tune it so it usually takes like what someone correct me if I'm wrong but it usually takes like 4X to 10x the amount of memory to fine-tune a model so you know we're we're still a little ways off but you know a couple more years and it'll be reasonable also as the cost of the hardware the capital investment comes down more and more companies are going to be able to offer fine-tuning services so say for instance you have a data set and you want to get Bloom fine-tuned and you then you want to you want to own it right so rather than rather than go and upload your data to a web interface and then they host your fine tune model they'll just give it to you right um so you can do fine tuning as a service and then you can then they can probably just sell you fine-tuned models right I know that from day one at open AI people were asking about sharing and selling fine-tuned models because there are independent uh consultants and small companies and startups that they just want to do bespoke fine-tuning models where that's like okay I fine-tuned this model now I'll sell it as a service you know for whatever whatever tasks whether it's legal inference medical summarization who knows who cares right um so there's there's this demand to release models now this is all language models so this takes me to this article that uh my fiance sent me um and so this is kind of this was the inspiration for today's uh today's episode like how did we get here and where are we going so AI art has been nothing short of um is is uh nothing short of like one it's it's impressive but it's also very controversial um so there's already been cases of of um you know people submitting AI art and it winning Awards or um of of art hosts uh Banning it and so then one of the most popular prompts uh one of is to use Greg Rakowski um and so like he is technically like people are using his name to generate art um I I read this article it's it's kind of boilerplate if you're familiar with uh with what's going on but it was it was good inspiration um and and it talks about how amongst other things um the the Leon um data set so there's uh let's see where is it Leon is the um the Leon 5B is the data set that was used to train it and it may or may not have been like ethically built but here's the other thing is it crosses International borders right so um you know uh IP laws in one nation might not apply the same that they do in another nation and then once you train a model like in Germany or America and the data was gathered in Germany or America and then the model goes somewhere else it's really confusing um now that's not to say that International IP laws have not been worked on for decades they have um I I pursued getting a patent uh many years ago and um you know basically it just cost 10 times as much to get you know International protection for your IP um and you know okay but you know is this a derivative work because when you when you look at existing um uh uh precedent legal precedent and jurisprudence you know because you're allowed to create something as long as you are adding value and creating something new so it's called a derivative work and by no means am I an expert on this this is just my you know like uh my my hot take so to me it seems like you you use one bit of data to train another and so writers writers know this um there are many writers who actually will refuse to read other works of fiction while they're working on their own fiction because you can't help but do neural style transfer when you're um when you're reading something and then and then producing your own work because your brain is primed with that information but the thing is it takes human work to do that and the same is true if you're looking at other artists and you're kind of like you know what looking at their art and then like oh I can do that or getting some inspiration from it um I had a I had a peace commissioned and I pulled from two dozen different artists and I I said Okay I want something that's like this this this and this and I paid for it um and but this other artist even though you know I gave I gave them some inspiration from other works of art they still put in you know a few dozen hours or however long it took them of their own work to make something new and unique so what happens when all of that work to derive a new work is done by a machine and all the human has to do is you know spend 30 seconds writing a prompt um is that the same and who knows I'm not going to try and litigate this this is this is obviously going to come down to probably some Landmark Supreme Court cases it's going to come down to um uh probably actually uh International Trade policy I suspect that um there will there that will end up with some like you know like nafta-esque like North America Free Trade Agreement things that we'll talk about um protecting artists and their IP and stuff but this is going to be the first I think that this is going to be the first major disruption um my fiance was talking to someone um who was a talent or no no no this was a job that she worked years ago um she worked for an indie press and the one of the founders of the Indy press had been a talent scout for uh graphic artists um I think it was in New York or some some you know some big metropolitan area anyways had been a talent scout and and an agent for artists back in the 90s 80s or 90s but then with the rise of the internet and Photoshop and stuff just those two things you know Photoshop and and and and internet it completely destroyed the need for um Talent uh talent scouts and agents because then they could just post their portfolios on the internet and so like what we're seeing is something similar where um all the AI art is gonna like you know all my thumbnails I do that with with Dolly right um I don't need an AI artist and it takes me in just a few seconds to do a thumbnail now so what happens with these new technologies is things get accelerated but it also um so it makes my my life faster and easier and cheaper but then it also means that I'm not like you know scouring the internet for for art um or you know doing something manually that takes longer um so and that's that's the nature of capitalism right it capitalism always seeks efficiencies so what happens to the you know hundreds of thousands or millions or however many graphic artists there are across the world who suddenly um can be out competed by a machine and even if the quality of the first generation is not that good this like Dolly stable diffusion mid-journey um all of these things are so good on their first for just you know version one what happens a year from now when not only are they faster and cheaper but they are better and more creative than all humans can be so we're looking at like millions of people out of work um and that is that is that's kind of scary and I think that this will ultimately be a wake-up call to people about how powerful AI is is can be for disruption um and then so what what's going to happen next is you're going to have pipelines right there's going to be and some folks are already working on this um oh I wish I had brought up a link I'll post it in the in the comments but basically there's a pipeline where you get a generation and then you have you feed it through something else to like upscale it or fix the faces and that's that's what human graphic artists do right like you do a rough sketch and then you refine it and then you refine it again and refine it again um and so but that's like such a straightforward Pipeline and all that's being worked on um and you know I wrote a post on LinkedIn a couple weeks ago about how even as a novelist um you know granted that's that's not my career that's just what I do for fun um I wasn't worried about AI kind of replacing novels uh or or you know disrupting that because I still have my own story to tell however um in a couple years once we figure out how to generate long format fiction um we're going to see an explosion we're going to see you know there are millions of books published every year right now soon it's going to be billions of books published every year um just as just as AI art is already generating millions and millions of new images per day so another thing that's going to happen is you're going to get this feedback loop someone on Twitter a few days ago kind of made this this quip that's like what happens when the AI models are all trained on AI generated data it's coming um you know with the Advent of language models uh they're all trained on data that was generated mostly by humans with a few like scripts and Bots here and there but over time especially when you look at like all the synthetic data experiments I do in the future all the language models are going to be trained on AI generated language so we're entering into a very new time in terms of data um and and art and I I would not have predicted you know I did not predict um that art was going to be the first major disruption but I think we're seeing the beginning of it now um so that's that that is my state of the industry update um yeah it's it's we're in for we're in for some serious change and that's that's about all I can say for certain um I I have I have accurately predicted some things and I have missed others so I'm I'm just going to leave it at that anyways
