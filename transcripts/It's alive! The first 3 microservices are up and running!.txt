morning everybody david shapiro here with any other another sorry i can speak i promise um brief uh research update so i've got um three micro services working um we've got the simulation microservice which i've been detailing over the last few days i've got the the universal sentence encoder or the embedding microservice running which has also been worked on for the last few days and then the nexus service so i've got all three of these things working together so basically what's going on is here on the right hand side you see a simulation running and in this case the simulation is a text-based simulation that is playing out a scene in uh that's it's an imaginary scene um it starts as just two men playing chess in central park in in new york city um and then it's kind of simulating what's happening um and they uh it just it's it's meant to be a virtual environment for um for testing artificial cognitive entities or agi uh acogs aces all different words mean the same thing um and so then the uh the semantic embedding microservice what it does is it takes as input either a sentence or a paragraph and it spits out a semantic embedding which allows the nexus to then search for it and so what you see over here is the nexus is actually spitting out its logs that it's receiving as it goes and so you see there's a few components that it shows is the timestamp the um the service that generated the message so this is important for orchestrating artificial cognition later on is that the conductor will need to be able to see which services are are producing which messages so that it can provide feedback um so it says hey you know you're misbehaving try a different model or do something else and then it actually has the the memory um in natural language now with each of these records is also the vector and a few other things there's a timestamp a uuid uh the semantic vector the content the service there will be other metadata in the future so for instance um the services will also register which model they're using or which mode they're in um so that metadata will be available to one every other service as well as the conductor but also for that service itself when it needs to fine tune its behavior later it says oh hey this model is not performing well so let's you know let's lower the score of that model so that it can do automated a b testing between different models this will be critical for self-correction and self-control later on in in in the process but so you see um in this case they've been they've been uh playing chess and now they're trash talking each other and getting more and more competitive as the darkness creeps in around them that's great um so this obviously without an agent uh intervening here um you know the story's just going in a previous version the um the men they got into a fist fight and they ended up in jail which was hilarious anyways so these are the first three micro services i just got them running hence the um hence the update next will be the core objective functions or what i sometimes call the heuristic imperatives um so the the the core objective functions are the central thing that um that i am proposing that artificial cognition uses and so uh the the um one way to think of it is like uh what is what is your reason for existing right what is your motivation every day we humans are very open-ended right we have a few basic imperatives such as like eat food drink water seek shelter you know a few like maslow's hierarchy of needs right well with an artificial entity it has no intrinsic needs other than electricity but we shouldn't make our machines intrinsically self-pres give them a sense of self-preservation because that will create a competitive environment and and when whenever you have a competitive environment you ultimately end up for a struggle or end up with a struggle for dominance which is not what we want because we must assume that these artificial cognitive entities will become smarter than us one day and we don't want to be out competed with them so instead we want to be them we want them to be intrinsically cooperative more on that later as i test the core objective functions because you know this simulation over here is talking about like two men playing chess other simulations that i'm gonna run are gonna include um war game scenarios like say for instance a final battle between man and machine how do the core objective functions behave or earth is being invaded by aliens how do the core objective functions behave then or in more benign situations let's say that there's a politically divisive issue um how does the how does the how does the uh the artificial cognitive entity navigate those difficult political issues that are not existential threats um so that is the point of having this simulation service and being able to test this so up next will be the core objective functions microservice which will be like the moral center of our machines um and then after that will be um actions and planning so you need you need an executive service so i had to do a little bit of research i've got my book over there neuroscience for dummies um because i just needed like one last little thing and i i had it mostly right um so the basal ganglia is part of the brain that is responsible for actually taking thought and deciding what to do so it's like the executive function um let's execute on this action and there's two primary behaviors of the basal ganglia one is selection and the other is switching so selection is given a whole host of options because whether or not you're conscious of it your brain is constantly generating dozens hundreds thousands of possible behaviors at any given moment for instance there's canonical neurons which anytime you see an object canonical neurons model what you can do to that object or with that object and so by learning how to interact with the world you have regions of the brain that are constantly telling your your brain like oh i can do that i can do this i can i can grab this i can throw that um there's other parts of your brain that are constantly dredging up memories by association and so those associative memories say oh the last time i saw this person they said this to me right and so i could say something back right um and so by by constantly generating a menu of options that you can choose from um that enables your basal ganglia to then select a behavior now the same thing can happen let's say that someone's talking to you and you hear them say something wrong another option that pops up is i can choose whether or not to interrupt this person and correct them right so that's a choice and then also switching so as information changes you might change task so for instance you might switch from listening to interrupting that is a behavior change or a state change um in fact this tried this this was this is modeled in um in primitive cognitive architectures that are used for say like the mars rovers rocket systems all kinds of things video game characters it's called a finite state machine so finite state machine says that there are there are a number of states that this machine can be in or this agent so i can be listening i can be speaking i can be interrupting i can be walking whatever and so basically what the basal ganglia does for us and as an organic machine is it helps us choose when to switch between tasks so that's one of the next microservices that i'll be working on is the executive service but before i have the executive service i need to have thinking service cognitive services that generate those lists of possibilities so yeah that's where we're going i just wanted to post a quick update because this is super exciting i've got these three services running so basically all that's running right now is kind of the the underlying infrastructure i've got the simulation running the nexus is running and then the semantic embedding service and also you don't have to if you want to do this you don't need to use my semantic embedding service you can just use open ai's or any number of other services but i use um google's universal sentence encoder because it's free and fast and it's also geared for smaller payloads which is all i need i don't need to you know you see how long these are they're about you know one one to five sentences or so um and that's all i need so anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe and also please consider supporting me on patreon so i can keep this research going and as always it will be forever open source because this is too damn important to have paywalled or privately owned so thanks
