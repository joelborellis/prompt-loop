good morning everybody david shapiro here with a quick video um so a few days ago i started my um my discord it was requested by popular demand and um in just a f like two or three days i have over 80 people um so i was expecting like maybe a dozen people but where this is a wonderful problem to have it far outstrips anything i had uh expected and i'm quickly learning about how to organize a community this large um so one thing that i wanted to do while doing a uh audio test um because what we're gonna do is is there's so many good conversations i'm gonna try and um host discussions uh as a podcast but anyways um there's a bunch of people that are new to discord or new tool uh discord this large and so what i wanted to do was just have a quick tutorial about threads so say for instance um you know you've got a channel and it's just it goes and goes and goes and you've got hundreds of responses and so what do you do well rather than making more channels so the little hashtag introductions hashtag fiction whatever that's a channel what you can do is you can do a sidebar conversation um and so how do you do that well first what you do is let's just go to um let's see this guy he asks a question so we'll say um all you do to start a thread here let me show you again is you just um hit the hashtag with the little comment button you say um this is a test thread and so there it um has it creates the thread and it keeps it in the sidebar like this right um you can uh let's see where is it some somewhere you can rename it i think it's up here leave thread so you can leave it you can mute it you can edit it um so i'll just say like test thread um save changes uh exit and so now there's a test thread and you can see that also pops up over here and let me zoom in a little bit um so test thread and then if you click on it here let me zoom back out if you click on it here then it becomes your primary focus so that makes it a little bit easier to focus entirely on just one uh one specific thread um and then because you know this is a larger server and it's growing um if you lose a thread you just click on active threads and it'll show all of them here um and so you can say like oh i was i wanted to talk about oh this is when we were talking about automation replacing people um you can go up here um and actually hang on my dogs barking okay and we're back and you can see my dog there he is that's tank he likes to bark a lot oh there he goes okay bring the microphone back all right sorry about that um yes okay so that's threads um another thing you can do is if you're not participating in a thread sometimes it doesn't show up here so if you're looking so you can click here for all threads but if you remember that there's a thread in a particular channel you can go here and click this and it'll show you just the threads in this channel and then one last thing is to see pinned messages um in the rules one i have this one pinned but you know there's only one message but to see pinned messages you click the little pin up here so um looks like nobody jumped in to the chat that's okay um we'll do a recording test later but i did want to just give a walk through about like here's how to do threads in here so i did add a fifth rule to the server which is use threads and that's just to keep it accessible um there's so basically what happened was a few different people messaged me and they said like this this is great but i only i can only check every now and then um and the conversation goes too fast so that led to two things one which is use threads so that way conversations can stay organized and people don't get left behind but then two we're going to do a podcast so the podcast will be we're just going to basically discuss like create an audio version discussing the things that we've been talking about in here i don't know if it'll work i don't know if anyone will show up but we'll see so once again just reviewing the rules keep it cool be kind this is meant to be a chill place and a positive experience for all not everyone is a native english speaker so be patient number two discussion not debate this isn't reddit this is a research group for collaboration education and sharing we're not here to prove anything right or wrong and that leads to rule number three agree to disagree you're not here to convince anyone of anything nor are you required to change your mind we are bringing many different ideas and disciplines together so there will be misunderstandings and disagreements that's okay that's part of the process beliefs and evidence share your beliefs and evidence they are yours and no one can take that from you respect other people's beliefs and evidence number five use threads as this community grows there's a need to keep conversations organized don't be shy about creating threads so the community remains accessible for everyone yes so um something i learned about building communities is that you want to have kind of a thr a high threshold of entry it's better to exclude people that are not going to play by the rules because um disruptive people will drive away the good people and you know just because someone is the most assertive or loudest doesn't mean that they're the smartest or kindest or best community member um and so that's why that's one of the reasons that i set the rules as i did but yeah so those that that's simple there's something else i wanted to mention um diversity equity and inclusion and accessibility are big here one of the things that you learn when you study accessibility and diversity is that when you make an environment more accessible to like anyone with disabilities or people of different ethnicities or people with language difficulties it actually gets better for everyone there are stories of like oh you know you make um what was it my my girlfriend and i were talking about um um uh anything that's disability accessible right um there are certain widths that doors need to be uh thresholds need to be completely smooth that sort of stuff um we we went to a hotel and i was just like why is this room feel different and she's like oh this is this is disability accessible because all the doors were really wide all the everything was really spacious and the and the there was no thresholds anywhere it was all perfectly smooth and i was like i really like this aesthetic like to me it was an aesthetic thing but it just it felt more accommodating and and that was like oh yeah like if you make it accessible for people in wheelchairs or with other mobility issues it actually becomes more accessible to everyone because the bathroom was really big right and so like the bathroom was big the shower was big um the entry hall was big and i just never felt cramped or claustrophobic um and the same applies to all kinds of stuff um so for instance when we do the podcast we're going to follow a format that is used all over the place this is a format that's used in 12-step programs it's used in conflict mediation it's used in our writing group this is actually where i learned it but basically we're going to have like one person talking or presenting um that'll be for five to fifteen minutes and then what we'll do is we'll do a round robin where everyone gets to share their thoughts and reactions to the presentation one at a time right so we don't have people that are going to be talking over each other we're not going to do crosstalk everyone will get a chance to just speak their mind you know in a minute or two about the topic and then after everyone who wants to have a chance because again some people are going to be shy some people are going to be introverted some people it takes them a while to gather their thoughts not everyone is like you know quick on the draw like like i am i am just ready to talk all the time um and so but by creating a structure that says like okay dave it's not your turn to talk it's this person's turn to talk you make it safer and more accessible to everyone and then once everyone has a chance to talk then we'll switch to um we'll switch to a normal conversation a free-for-all so every topic that we talk about on the on the podcast we'll have three phases there'll be the presentation phase the round robin phase and then the free-for-all phase um yeah okay well unfortunately it looks like nobody jumped into the podcast that's fine i do this spontaneously mostly i just wanted to record this video about rules how to how to run a community um and just yeah uh encourage this this discord community to to keep going we've already got some of like so many incredible people involved we've got lawyers we've got people in all levels of their career and academia we've got people with children people without children we've got we've got artists we've got people that have traveled a lot we've got polyglots um it's just i never in my wildest dreams would i have thought that so many people would gather so quickly and this was like not even my idea like this is what you all asked for um and also like it just hit me yesterday like this is like the people involved already and the people that could become involved like this is um this is a group that can like change the world um and i see myself not as like a leader but as a servant right like i'm just sharing my ideas and then people asked me to create this space where they could come together and talk and that's what i did right and then people asked for um the audio channels for accessibility because some people struggle with typing um or or reading they they prefer verbal communication i was like okay cool i'll do that um then people like wanted a podcast so that way they could digest the whole thing without having to sit on it every day because like some people have children or day jobs or whatever they can't they can't sit in front of a discord channel all day long um and so i see myself more as a like a servant rather than a leader or you know leader as servant anyways i'm rambling now um just wanted to introduce the discord channel my discord server which is the cognitive i cognitive ai lab there we go and then also talk about the upcoming podcast so i think that we're going to be recording the podcast wednesday evening 8 p.m u.s east time and yeah we'll see how it goes obviously this is an evolving process but this is what people wanted and it aligns with my goals professionally and uh and and personally so here we go thanks for watching
