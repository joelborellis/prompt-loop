hey everybody David Shapiro here with a really exciting announcement so I've been hinting at this uh but I'm working on getting a team built for auto Muse okay so what is auto Muse Auto Muse is a collection of AI tools to help creative writers to help fiction writers so I have been working with uh powerful AI tools like large language models such as gpt3 for a couple years now and of course one of the first things that you do when you play with a model like this is you want to try and generate fiction you write stories with it you do characters and uh so I've been doing all kinds of experiments I'm not going to go into demos on this video but suffice to say I've experimented with novel writing prose writing writing scripts creative writing chat Bots that you can work with to work on Pros feedback and critique models and so over time I've had people ask me like Dave when is the next Auto Muse project coming out um Dave can I use this can you make this user friendly because I'm just a writer and I don't know code can you make this for me and so I'm listening and and people people want this now I will say that I was afraid of releasing this for a while because I was like you know what all of my best friends are writers and I don't want to hurt my friends I don't want to put them out of business and I don't want to put editors out of business either so I had to think about it for a while and then I realized no what am I going to do I'm not going to aim for you know professional writers and professional editors it's going to be a while before AI can compete with them no what I'm going to do is I'm going to aim for everyone who wants to be a writer so the vision statement for auto Muse is to help every aspiring author become or sorry every aspiring writer to become an author and so what I mean by that is everyone has a story everyone has a story that they want to tell but writing is hard writing a novel takes years of work and there's lots of learning that has to go into it and so Auto Muse is going to be um it's going to be a set of tools that will just help you write it'll help you organize and brainstorm but it'll also teach you the art of writing through uh chat Bots critical feedback and really tight Loops that will teach you the art of writing um so like what kind of tools am I talking about I've already mentioned a couple so one that I've got built and working is my synopsis generator so you just give it a few ideas and it will it will give you a full synopsis for the story that you want um and then you can take that synopsis and you can expand it into a plot I've got a plot generator so it'll give you all the major plot beats that you need to hit with that story and then one thing that I'm working on beyond that is to take those plot beats and generate scenes with it and so you have this expansion over time and eventually you end up with an entire story now there's a lot of work to do if you watch the rest of my YouTube videos you'll see that you know I put an hour or two of work into these every now and then but I need to do it full time in order to make it polished and ready for for Mass consumption and then we will uh we'll get a closed beta I think the limit is 15 people and I'm going to select people from the closed beta or for the closed beta first the right of first refusal will be from my patrons on patreon so if you want to get in the door go sign up on patreon um and then if you uh and then also if you if you don't want to go that route you can also just sign up on automews.io contact and just fill in some information and so for everyone in the closed beta it's going to be a participatory dialogue we'll be in touch with you to ask you know what it is that you want how are you using the tool what's working what isn't but we'll also ask you to try and break the tool right you try and try and make it do something that it's not supposed to do or I shouldn't say tool tools anyways uh this video has gone on more than long enough I just wanted to announce uh Auto Muse so if you want to sign up go to automews.io contact and sign up there that will put you on the waiting list but also if you want to get higher on the waiting list go ahead and sign up and support me on patreon and that will be where we pick from first for the closed beta anyways thanks for watching um yeah take care
