morning everybody today's state of the industry update is going to be exclusively about pie torch so i woke up and checked the news and the first thing i saw was that meta was or previously known as facebook was um moving pi torch over to the linux foundation um and so basically uh and the links will be up uh down in the comments um here's their blog post where they announced that there's plenty of other articles um where they uh where they talk about it um so basically what's happened is pie torch is moving from meta's governance to the linux foundation's governance um and there's a so here's the home page for the pi torch foundation which was just created so this gives you a little bit more information about what it is but it's got a very simple charter um they're democratizing state of the art tools you know it's pretty boilerplate all the members you see that it's not just meta there's microsoft nvidia google aws and so one thing that you might think is okay a lot of these are competitors why are they working together and i am reminded of the united states rail system so in the early days of the industrial revolution there were different size of rails there was different standards for trains and so you'd have track widths and track dimensions and train dimensions and you'd have trains that could only run on certain rails and uh that was no good so what happened is all of the different rail companies got together and said we need to pick a standard and there are still places in the world where there are different sized rails and it causes all kinds of problems and so that continues today though so actually uh almost 10 years ago now maybe about 10 years ago i interviewed at a company that runs the software that organizes all the rails all the railways in america today and this company is created and maintained just like this by all the rail companies and so this is the signaling software that is used to make sure that no trains run into each other and so when you have a large ecosystem it behooves all the companies participating in that ecosystem to collaborate to make sure that they use the same standards and so while it might not it might not be quite intuitive at first the fact that all these different companies can contribute to this tool set because that's what pytorch is pytorch is a tool set that allows you to create deep neural networks fast and efficiently it behooves them to work together because then they're going to get better tools and they're going to get standards and so what does that mean well one that means that a model built by meta might be useful to amazon or microsoft or nvidia but also it has to do with employees so one thing that can happen is and this is this is true whenever there's a niche or niche technology i used to say niche but then someone taught me to say niche and that sounds better because it sounds french so niche technology where there's only like a handful of people that know it and google is the only one who needs it right so then they can't find anyone to hire to use that technology well by making technologies more standard and this this happens in cycles this has happened in in the technology sphere since before my career i think it's been going on forever but basically um the industry will have to start with a shotgun method right where there's when you've got a new um blue field or a blue ocean exploration there's going to be hundreds of different tools and only a few people know each one but then eventually one of those will emerge as the dominant tool and for the longest time i thought it was going to be tensorflow and keras but it looks like pie torch is the one that is emerging that doesn't mean that it's going to go away it just means that one is going to be more popular the same thing happened with python um just before i started my career uh python 2 was just becoming like a big thing there's actually an xk cd let's see xk cd python can do yeah you see i search for this um how old is this um yeah so python um you can do anything with python uh where's the date for this i wish i knew how old it was but this comic is like 13 plus years old um and so this was like people were just discovering how awesome python was 13 to 15 years ago and now it is standard and so what you what you see is like you've got tensorflow keras fast ai calf opencv all of these are kind of like aging and falling by the wayside in favor of tensorflow and pie torch and so this move to um to move pytorch to the linux foundation is going to ensure that it takes its place among open source tools like python like linux so i would not be surprised if pytorch is like the status quo moving forward um in terms of deep learning so a little bit more about pi torch it's up on pi pi so you just pip install torch that's how it goes um they do it they i somewhere on here i i saw that it recommends um gpu like that's really what it was built for was gpu acceleration um they have a hub just like tensorflow has their hub so uh what that means is that with uh pi torch hub you can just download pre-trained models you don't need to train them yourself which this is one thing that makes uh makes this ecosystem all the better um if you've watched some of my other videos you know that i am a big fan of google's universal sentence encoder um and they have lots of models up here like they have obviously tensorflow hub has way more models than pytorch hub which only has 48 but still it's not a matter of quantity it's a matter of quality um and that's not to say that google couldn't make a comeback because google has i mean they basically launched the modern transformer um not war um but like cascade with technologies like the universal sentence encoder because that is that is half of the transformer the other half came later um and you know with bert you know they've revolutionized search um and and all sorts of other things and this is just with the the text models so i don't know how it's going to play out um but it is an interesting move and it certainly increases the chances that pi torch is going to be the universal standard for deep learning um within a few years so anyways that's my state of the industry update for this morning thanks for watching like and subscribe and consider supporting me on patreon have a good one
