hey everybody david shapiro here with a uh the first video in a new tutorial series so this is python and gpt3 from the ground up so if you don't know anything about python or gpt3 and you want to get into it start here so this is going to be the boot camp starting from zero starting from scratch so the first thing you're going to want to do is take a look at this comic from xkcd from 10 15 years ago it basically it's just making fun of how simple python is the the punch line is um how are you flying and i just i just typed import anti-gravity and then of course he sampled all the things in the medicine cabinet and then now he's flying um anyways so the first thing you do is you go to python.org downloads it downloads pretty quick you do install now and so the first time i did this i missed this because we're doing something so simple you don't need to worry about virtual environments so you make sure to click add python to path and you can expand here to see what else it'll do documentation that's fine pip you definitely need pip so pip is the pack package manager for python which allows you to install other stuff that python needs so that's fine install for all users you don't always need to do that but i do so that puts it right here in the standard thing again don't worry about virtual environments we're just going to install it as the system interpreter using virtual environments is more advanced so we're not going to worry about that so there you go i actually uninstalled python entirely just so to show like going from scratch um so this is python 3.10 that's the latest and greatest it's the same process uh probably forever it's been it's been the same for all of 3.3. it didn't used to come with pip you used to have to install that separately so the fact that they they include that now is is nice let me close my console so once this is done it'll add python to the um there we go okay so python dash dash version 3.10.5 there we go so pip install pip dash dash upgrade so you can do this it's recommended that that's the first thing that you do and because it upgrades your package manager so the command here is pip so that's the python package manager install pip so you're telling it to install something that's already there and then the dash dash upgrade tells you to upgrade now the very next thing you're going to want to do is install openai if you want to use gpt3 this is the module or the package that you can use and all you got to do is copy that to clipboard and you do control paste or shift insert for a command line pip install open ai and this is most of the way there so it'll run all the dependencies and unless your system is weird or something you shouldn't get any errors here this is pretty straightforward and if you already have open ai installed then you can just add that dash dash upgrade and away it goes that's giving me a few few notices yep which is not on path that's fine successfully installed ta-dah okay so we're most of the way there you're most of the way ready but now what how do you get code so if you watch my channel you'll know that i have i do a lot of code and i put all of my code up on github so how do you get stuff quickly and easily the answer there is you use git so you go to git dash scm.com downloads or slash download sorry you get you download git i've already got it but i'll go ahead and install the update so you can see the process so we will install git for windows um install removing previous get version so this is pretty much the same process you'll go through so what git does it is an open source code management tool it has become the standard code management tool globally we don't need to see the release notes okay so now that git is installed what do you do then what i do next or what i'll have you do next is you go to your command line um and you go to this repo so this is the this is the tutorial repo i'll put all the all the code and demos here so you go to this you click code the big green button and you see where it says https ssh or github cli just leave it on https that's the standard you click this for copied you come back in here you go to the root which you don't have to that's what i do you can also do cd um oh what was it no it's cd uh was it user i don't remember um user der whatever um i always copy stuff down to root just because uh it's shorter that way um so get clone and then shift insert um for for this uh and so this this goes to the python gbt3 tutorial dot git so the dot get file is the configuration file that it's going to use to download the entire repo so get clone and it down downloads it nice and quick then you do cd python and use tab to complete so tab is autocomplete so like if you type in windows and then complete like just win tab that'll do complete you can do program files and there's two different ones program data program files but we're going to go into python and then we'll do dur now windows started integrating uh linux command so i think ls dash all nope it doesn't work okay but dura will show you everything in the file which right now since i just started it it's fine okay so for review we've downloaded python and we've downloaded git and then we've cloned down this repo we've also installed um open ai so we're like right off the bat we've we've got a nice minimalist clean environment the last thing that i want you to download is notepad plus plus and this is if you're on windows actually i think notepad plus plus is on linux as well notepad plus plus is a basic text editor wait that's not what i wanted there we go um so they do have that deceptive thing make sure you click the the download on under the the lizard icon um notepad plus plus it is a minimalist development environment there are develop there are ides integrated development environments um like pycharm i stopped using pycharm years ago because it has its own environment variables and all sorts of other complex stuff that is just it's way overkill and i wanted the simplest environment possible so notepad plus plus it'll it'll do the um the language for you and everything one reason that i like using notepad plus plus over pycharm is that you have to learn to code correctly um pycharm will do a lot of stuff for you it's kind of like microsoft word and it'll recommend grammar and syntax changes which is great except you don't ever learn to do that yourself and we'll get into best practices for python in a future video but right now we're just focusing on setting up our environment and so what we've done is we've done python we've done git we've done notepad plus plus we've done open ai and then we've gotten this repo now by the time you download this there will be a little bit more in this repo so let me show you what i mean by in the repo so we'll just say copy paste your api key here so then i'll save this file we'll go to what was it uh python there we go um and so we'll call this open ai api key dot text and so we'll save this here and what i'll do is this will end up in here and so you'll go to your open ai account so it'll be um openai.com account api keys right here i'm not going to show you my key but what you do is you you click copy on that and you put it in this folder and so then we're basically just going to do the hello world of of um of gpt3 so import openai we'll just go ahead and save this and i'll save it as hello world.pi and you see that it changed the the formatting so that now import is highlighted i am super guilty of this i always copy paste my own all of my own old code um so i'm gonna do that real quick um and show you some basic functions that i use all the time um all right so we'll go in here oops no don't open that we will open it in a notepad plus plus okay so i always start with these few things right off the top and i'll show you what these do in just a second actually let me check the video length oh we're already at 10 minutes um so we're kind of we're kind of running long already but this will at least get you started with the hello world of of um your your your your life your life in gpt3 so i just write a quick function it's called open file you give it a file path it opens it um with encoding as utf-8 as in file and then it returns the contents of the file and then the very next thing is i return that and i pass this information back and so then what you can do oops is you can borrow this function which will be in this and i'll trim it down for you and you'll know that it works though because we'll i'll have you call this and you'll actually get a prompt or you'll get you'll get a response what i'm going to do is i'm going to simplify it a little bit because if it blows up i want you to do some troubleshooting on your own um and then we'll remove the while loop and we'll remove the accept part and we'll pull that back whoops okay so what this function does the first one super simple it just opens a file reads it and sends it back um we the second thing what we did is we set our api key to the contents of this which you'll need to update um and uh no special important note don't ever commit your api key to a repo because uh then someone else might see it one day that should be local only um we will simplify this [Music] so this is the stop we'll get into what all of these things do later um but yeah so this what this will do is it will just send back a completion and so then we'll say if name equals main [Music] then we'll say um my prompt equals uh what'll be a good prompt um write a list of uh of um famous american actors okay so that'll be our prompt then response will be equals uh gpt3 whoops completion and we'll pass the prompt in and then we'll print the response now i'm not going to run this because your homework is you've got to run this yourself which means you've got to get all this cloned downloaded and put in your api key here and we'll call that a day so just as a quick review here's what we've done we we looked at our xkcd comic from many years ago we downloaded python we downloaded git we downloaded notepad plus plus we installed openai which allows us to talk to gpt3 and then we cloned down this tutorial repo and then i showed you how to get your api key so what you'll do is you'll just click this that copy button come in here to open ai key open ai api key dot text and copy paste it in here make sure there's no spaces or anything it'll just be the first line and that's it and then what you do and this is going to bomb in order to test it you type in python hello world and it's not going to work um except finally oh whoops see this is why you test your code kids what did i miss oh i forgot to remove the try there we go ta-da okay now it works it would be really unfortunate if i sent you code that didn't actually work okay now this will still bomb because the api key is invalid so let me show you what will happen so it'll say hello world it'll say uh hey something didn't work you know uh open ai yep so here's the error right here open ai error authentication incorrect api key provided um it did not like my api key so you need to fix that that is your very first homework so then to save save your work um or to save my work i'll do git add dot so then i do that adds all files so then i do get stat um no git status sorry um so there's two new files to add so i'll do git commit am and we'll do a deeper dive on git in the future and we'll say initial commit and then i'll do git push and so what that does is it says okay every i've looked at all the changes that i've made locally i want to push it back up to the cloud so what we'll do then is we'll go back up to git and i'll just do a quick refresh and you'll see that those files are now here and so these are the files that you're going to use to start learning python and get your environment set up okay i think that's it thanks for watching like and subscribe also consider supporting me on patreon i am just seeing where this goes also i have a discord server if you'd like to join to get um uh some insight info to discuss research topics so on and so forth um that's about it thanks for watching check catch you next time
