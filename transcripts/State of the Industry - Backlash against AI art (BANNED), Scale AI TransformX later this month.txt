morning everybody david shapiro here with a uh state of the industry video it's a second one in my new series where i just kind of help you keep your finger on the pulse of the industry of ai broadly um but right now transformer space such as um image generation and natural language processing first i want to do a little bit of housekeeping though so as you may or may not know i am set up on patreon um so before we get started if you would consider hopping over to my patreon it's patreon.com daveshap and consider supporting me here um yeah that's i love what i do and and if you help support me maybe one day i can do this full time who knows anyways another thing that i wanted to do is do just a tiny bit of um self-disclosure and and raise awareness so i'm on the spectrum which whenever i tell people no one is surprised i guess i'm that weird it's pretty transparent anyways i wanted to share two books i've talked about them before unmasking autism and the pattern seekers um so basically i didn't know that i was autistic and i discovered it in my mid-30s like a lot of people do i discovered i did what many people do which is go down youtube rabbit holes find other autistic content creators and listen to their stories but what i will say is that these books are really helpful so devin price unmasking autism this really expanded my understanding of what of how autism presents in different people and you realize that autism is way more common than you think and then the other one is the pattern seekers which is kind of the more conventional definition of autism where it's like you know you've got the the the genius inventor kind of model um which is simon's um primary thing so you know take that part with a grain of salt but one thing that i learned from from this book is that of all the genes identified that are associated with autism the vast majority of them are common variants it's just a matter of if you've got you know 100 of these variants versus 200 versus 50. um so it's it's not it's not even like a mutation it's just random recombination of common genes okay so with all that said housekeeping out of the way um subreddits are starting to ban ai art i've seen there's been a lot of consternation on twitter about ai art obviously you know you get the stable diffusion hashtag and you see plenty of stuff i love it but the big concern is what's in the training data and you see that unstable diffusion has been banned so unstable diffusion was about all the weird cringy violent or sexual generations from stable diffusion reddit just flat out banned it and then i checked on twitter and twitter has actually purged most unstable diffusion tags look at this this is crazy there's only like a dozen less than a dozen unstable diffusion tags so it's pretty normal for there to be backlash against anything that changes um you know like people were people were grumpy about radio and other things so like you see stable diffusion is alive and well um but there's backlash so i heard a rumor that art station was gonna start banning um ai art and again it's it's mostly for for concern for the artists and copyright law so this has yet to be litigated um in the in the courts um if you do a quick search there's there is like what it looks like is that the at present it's not possible to copyright ai generated art there's a little bit of legal precedent for that i don't know if it's going to stand up so again it's got it's going to be litigated however so here's the thing a lot of folks so you look at the reason that unstable diffusion was banned so quickly um there was a great video i think it was on nebula if i find it i'll put a link in the in the comments speaking of um you all need to behave because i turned off my comments um and and my life got better um because the paradox of becoming more popular is that there's more trolls and more people who just want to argue look i've been on the internet for a long time i've been on plenty of debate forums i got it out of my system you do not want to debate me i am better at it than you um so if you get grumpy at me i just block you right i don't have any time for debate uh it's a waste of time and mental energy anyways okay so rewinding um where was i uh yeah so anyways um there's always backlash against against these new new new um new technologies and new changes oh here's another stable diffusion video these are great like why would people want to ban this entirely new art form now that being said there is a legitimate concern for copyright law existing artists so on and so forth but this is a whole new space right like you can't put this genie back in the bottle there and there are also countless examples throughout history of when new technologies cause a lot of uh pain and grumpiness so the vcr which is now an outmoded technology video copying and recording the vhs players and recorders though they tried to ban those because it was too easy to record broadcasts from um from uh uh for what am i trying to say blah sorry um like radio broadcasts uh or tv broadcast but also to copy other movies and stuff and so but did that work no they said like um the vcr itself is a neutral technology it's if you use it you know that's why all the videos if you're old enough to remember the fbi warning of doom at the beginning of every vhs video which is it is illegal to make copies of this so they reminded you all the time and so technologies are generally neutral what they do is they ban um they ban uh certain behaviors right and so the reason that unstable diffusion was banned this is this is the surprising part um is actually credit card companies so credit card companies stand behind all internet transactions basically whether it's a for-profit site like it's you know you're selling something or if it's an ad generate ad ad revenue um site the the payment processors stand behind all of that and if the payment excuse me if the payment processors see like child porn or other illegal content that they will say hey you need to take that down and so you know that and that's it's it's not even it's not even uh legally required but the the payment processors they don't want anything to tarnish their reputation great documentary i'll post it on the on the comments if uh if i find it i'm pretty sure it was on nebula anyways so you have this this like this breaking mechanism right so there's gas and breaks the people that are standing on the gas like me are just like let's go go go let's find new stuff let's do like take off the gloves let's go let's explore but then there's breaks right there's there's people um talking about ai ethics there's there's legislation there are the payment processors so there's all kinds of breaking mechanisms um and this pattern has existed throughout history um you go back in time to the french revolution um you know the progressives were the ones that were saying abolish the monarchy and the conservatives were saying you know maybe reinstate the monarchy this is a pattern that has existed throughout all of human history where you've got one group of people that want change and another group of people that fight change that is just human nature and that is the process working out it's the pendulum swinging back and forth you see it in politics today you see it in technology today as normal so i'm not worried about it we'll figure it out okay so moving on um i wanted to also introduce you to lexica so lexica was i think someone on the discord um posted this basically it's a search engine where you can find um stable diffusion and mid-journey or just ai art um uh uh generations and then the prompts used to create them wow these are disturbing um i haven't scrolled down that far yet anyways so um yeah if you want to get better like practice right but this is like i think it said it's got five million stable diffusion images and their text prompts um one thing that about stable diffusion though is that there's a lot of parameters you can plug in um but you know i mentioned a minute ago like you can't put this genie back in the bottle um the weights are out the model is out people are getting better at making these models so you know like you can legislate against it but it's gonna be there like it's just a matter of how do you manage the chaos um so yeah lexica it's pretty cool um i think it's free yeah so you just search um and there you have it there's a lot of skin um it's all art though and i don't see any like actual like straight up nudity or porn um but yeah so there's oops i didn't mean to close that come on okay lexica um oh yeah so another thing to introduce um this popped up in my twitter feed and i i regret that um i just went to a conference so i'm not going to be able to go to another one but um transform x is coming up at the end of the month so transform x is is hosted by scale ai and there are a lot of speakers um so you've got people from meta google cohere um let's see there's google waymo openai uh so you've got people from all the big players speaking at um at and attending um transform x um i didn't know about it i just found about out about it because i just got on twitter and i follow all the ai people so ibm openc scaleai you.com i'm not familiar with that um let's see berkeley ai lab um yeah so you got all kinds of people um that are gonna be there so uh i don't know if you can it looks like it's in person only yeah it's gonna be in san francisco of course that's where i just was um yeah so and then last but not least um so i definitely recommend you check out scale.com events slash transform x um i will be probably following the hashtag whatever they whatever they do okay so last i introduced forefront ai before so forefront is a small and growing um nlp company um they have that you can get on their discord um and the the founder is he's he's a great guy he will answer questions it's still small enough that you can interact with basically the whole team so another another group that is a little bit more larger is um is nlp cloud so a lot of the folks on my discord well it's no longer mine but i just say my discord it's the cognitive ai lab discord um love nlp cloud so nlp cloud it is it's ready to go um it is uh they've got a lot of models um let's see if you scroll down like you've got all kinds of use cases ready to go their documentation is definitely up to snuff you can fine tune and train your own models they've got gpu backing they've got multilingual support so like this is this is good to go so if you want to get more into um into nlp but you don't want to pay or you don't want to um you don't want to get locked in with proprietary closed source models i also recommend you check out nlp cloud also i know that a couple weeks ago i said that i was switching to all open source and then literally later that day open ai cut their price by two-thirds so went from six cents per thousand tokens to two cents per thousand tokens so um there is definitely an arms race going on but yeah i think that's about it for the uh for um the uh state of the industry today this morning um again check out my patreon consider supporting me there um uh keep an eye out for um ai art getting banned or that conversation advancing um it seems like there is the backlash um don't threaten artists apparently some ai artists are getting death threats online i mean i know that that's that's what the internet does but that doesn't mean it's okay um so just don't do that and then there's lexica the the search engine for ai art prompts so again like there's opportunity here you know like personally i think that that all the art places like deviant art and art station and stuff they should embrace it because otherwise they're going to get left behind but who knows it'll shake out how it shakes out um and then there's transform x on october 19th so that's nine days from now actually um and then finally i wanted to introduce you to nlp cloud um one of the models that nlp cloud has is actually a instruct fine-tuned gpt neo-x i haven't used it yet but some of the folks on the discord swear by it they say that it performs just as well as on openai's gpt3 instruct series models but it's open source um that is uh that's trained on alan ai's uh instruct series i believe so anyways there you have it thanks for watching this has been my second state of the industry uh address so thanks for watching and check you next time
