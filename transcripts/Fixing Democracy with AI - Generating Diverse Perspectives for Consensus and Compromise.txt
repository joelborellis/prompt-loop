morning everybody David Shapiro here um first I need to apologize that it's been so long since I've had a video um there's a couple reasons for it but mostly is uh I've been working too hard um many people on my channel have commented on how fast I work and uh apparently I'm really bad at at managing my own stress level so I got myself a nice Fitbit to uh keep track of those things for me um I sprang for the uh the Fitbit premium which has a like sleep score and daily Readiness score and Stress Management score and that's been really helpful so I've been learning to take better care of myself and Pace myself with that being said I um have a lot more energy so I can tackle this project that I've had in the back of my mind for a while so before we get started on this project I need to tell you why I'm doing it so first is uh the thing that you need to understand is consensus now I've talked about this on my channel before this is one of like if you ever if you read only one book this year you should read this book it changes everything I actually have two copies because I lost I lost it and bought another one but it turns out I lost it just because it's so small and it was like tucked beside a larger book on my bookcase over there so now I have two copies I can give one away anyways it's a short book and it talks about the how and why of consensus and also how to use it to run meetings and stuff it changes your life in terms of work it changes your your home life once you understand consensus now an individual doing consensus is one thing or a small group doing consensus right like I use it at work so one example is um without getting into too many specifics um like if you if you're trying to solve a tough technology problem um you know you might come in if you're egotistical and say okay I've got the solution we're going to do things my way I'm the decider right um but if you do that like people don't like being just told what to do and they also don't like being treated like they're dumb so this is another another principle that comes from a book The Fifth Discipline which is humans are literally the smartest animal on the planet treat humans like they are smart and they will surprise you um you know if you if you treat someone like you just want them to be a dumb Cog in a machine they will eventually start acting like a dumb Cog in a machine and you'll have this self-fulfilling prophecy where you treat someone dumb and you don't expect intelligence of them and then they don't deliver intelligence and then you say aha see they didn't deliver intelligence so that's from The Fifth Discipline um consensus is how to be inclusive like this it's genuinely how to be inclusive and it's not saying like we're going to be inclusive but it is a framework of how to approach problems okay the fundamental rule or one of the fundamental rules of consensus is you have to hear from everyone um and all voices are are it's not it's not even about equality it's just about integrating everyone's perspective so that sets the stage I have had this idea of using Ai and automation to simulate Mass opinions and model entire populations um my ex-brother-in-law uh is an economist and we had conversations about like using simulations to model like every individual as an agent in the economy and he's like that would be really difficult but why because you can just aggregate people um he's a smart guy anyways but simulating someone from an as an economic entity is one thing right because you can you can there's a lot of data on how people you know how much money they make and based on how much money you make where you spend that money and you look at demographics and and so on and so forth but what about social issues what about things that people care about I mean you people care about money and their ability to feed themselves but there's other issues right like there's fundamental disagreements over like corporate personhood and abortion rights and privacy rights and you can't model that with money um these are these are these are emotional issues these are spiritual issues and uh they're racial issues they're issues of social justice and you know you ask an economist what's important and they say it's only the money that's important that was the most infuriating part about talking to my brother-in-laws if it wasn't in the market it didn't matter um and I'm like that's not how reality works but you know he's an economist Nobody's Perfect um anyways so the whole point of this now that you've had the the had the stage set for you and I know that this is long and rambling but you know what you all love my longer videos and this is a very this is an issue that is near and dear to me um and actually I've got an interview a podcast coming up that talks about amongst other things consensus so I'm kind of setting the stage for that now okay so Dave you're crazy you're you can't use an AI machine to simulate human emotions and what people want um well just sit tight and see and wait till the end of the video and then let me know what you think all right so I started let me show you where I started I started with um just a few experiments so under the examples test01 um so I I created a little you know dossier of someone right just key demographics right adasi for the following person here let me zoom in on this a little bit um the goal is to capture enough information about this person to perform market research political surveys etc etc so income hundred thousand dollars occupation trucker State Oregon white 56 detail dossier it basically just restated um you know what I said he's likely to be a blue collar worker who's politically conservative and socially traditional so that was that was some interesting value added intuited that he's probably a gun owner and enjoys hunting and fishing because he's a white older white guy or middle-aged white guy from Oregon um who who has a um I don't I mean Trucking Trucking it you have to be licensed for that I don't know if I'd call that blue blue collar um but it's not what you'd call a knowledge worker a skilled labor he's likely to be suspicious of government and wary of foreign countries he's a Christian and goes to church regularly his family man who's married with Children um yeah so you know stereotypes exist for a reason and I was like okay this is this is okay but there's no Nuance to this right this is just a statistical likelihood so I was not happy with this example I'm like okay so we just proved that you know with a few data points gpt3 understands stereotypes that's not I mean yes there are there are people that study sociology and psychology and like there is some there is some validity to stereotypes but we don't want to reward that so I tried again um and it you know I was like okay what are his political views what is what are their social views what are his other interests and again it was very stereotypical so not helpful we're not getting any Nuance from this um so then I was like okay what's a world view like can we can we do this on scalars and so then I added a whole bunch more things because I was just thinking through like okay you know income skin color age you know some basic demographics like but what about their personality can we get Nuance by adding in someone's personality and so I created a bunch of scalars where so it goes from like one to ten and unlike you know selfish to generous and curious or incurious to curious and it was I I tried this and I thought it was working at first right because I plugged in an issue I realized like okay you can you can write a dossy about someone but if you're not reacting to something you're not really getting their opinion right you're getting who they are not an opinion um and so I plugged it in and all these scalers and stuff and I was like wow this is really nuanced you know this is um the topic was there's a bill that bans abortions under all circumstances and you know um you know it had a it had some you know vanilla talking points um but I ran it a few times on a few different personalities and realized that it was generating basically the same output so gpt3 is aligned to be vaguely Progressive um and kind of ignore other information to the contrary with this format so I was like okay you know I understand that that you know researchers um are very concerned about ethics and Alignment but they're letting their own bias seep into this information um you know because nothing in here talked about like oh hey the fact that like I um I'm Middle Eastern right it didn't it didn't integrate that cultural information into this output um it was just kind of generic it could have been written by anyone um it also didn't integrate the fact that it was a transgender woman right um where it's like you know as a trans woman I can't get pregnant but you know the whatever um so there's it's still lacking Nuance so I wasn't happy with that but we're making progress right because you look you look at this detailed essay on how I feel about this okay cool it's generating a lot of opinions and explanation as to why um and then brainstorming uh potential compromises on new Solutions this is where consensus comes in okay so the whole point of this now that I've I've set the stage even more um the point of consensus is that it is an alternative to democracy um on the grandest scale it's an alternative to democracy and with democracy you have up and down voting right you might have simple majority where you just need greater than 50 of the votes you might have a super majority which could be two-thirds of the votes um you then you can have all kinds of other little you know things like uh uh um not a block uh what do you call it the the filibuster um basically a block where someone you know a small group a minority a minority group says we're so opposed to this we're going to stall everything just to prevent it from happening and by the way blocks exist in consensus too now the thing about consensus though is that it's not it's not a vote as like okay someone proposed this issue now we're going to vote on it and move on no consensus takes a lot longer because it requires lots of negotiation because it includes everyone's voice and well how do you include everyone's voice because you can never come up with a solution that satisfies everyone well the point is is that you have to be very creative with consensus um and and you might come up with something that is not necessarily how am I trying to say this like let's let's take the issue of abortion for instance the initial question the initial proposal might be hey let's ban abortion after 12 weeks and then you get you know uh the progressives and the conservatives arguing you get men and women arguing you get um you know socially traditional people and socially moderate uh moderate modern people all arguing and you have you know 90 million different perspectives on abortion and people bring up different different issues right different uh points of concern so one person might be concerned about women's rights and women's bodily autonomy other people might be concerned about a fetus's right to life or is that is that like is that against their religion right does it do they have a duty to protect unborn um all these things and so then what you do is you integrate all of those feedback um and then you come up with a solution it's you have to you have to explore with consensus and you go forward and you say okay well what is something what are the issues that people really care about right what is it what is it that that that they need in order to be happy or satisfied with this and you know some people will just kind of dig in their heels and say no I'm not going to budge okay well so one of the first lessons of consensus is if you're just going to be stubborn um you don't you're not you shouldn't participate in consensus because by virtue of entering into to a system of consensus you have to be willing to make compromises but it's not just a matter of okay well we can keep the the abortion ban at 12 weeks if you give me this not that kind of compromise you have to be more creative than that because when you explore the issue of abortion for instance you will one of the one of the issues is the topic of of um of uh unwanted or accidental or like forced pregnancies right like in the cases of children being involved or rape or whatever and um and so you say okay well what what about preventing like what about preventing that from happening what if what if part of part of this issue is we have to address um safety for vulnerable women and girls right and it's like okay well so now the compromise isn't you know changing the goal post of where the abortion ban is the the the the the compromise is let's address these other things too let's it's it's not no but or or no end it's yes and right that is the responses okay I hear your concern here so let's address that and this other thing that I care about right and so you explore this further and at the heart of it at one of the one of the reactions for men for instance is um like father's rights or or um or liability right um Financial liability um some people don't want to not have any you know like two people decide to have sex right and one of them gets pregnant and if that one has all the all the power in the situation all the control that doesn't feel fair to the other party um and you know so like two people and decided to engage in an act knowing the risks and then the risk um the one party has total control over if one party has total control over all outcomes and responsibility that feels very unsafe to the other one so how do you address that and part of that might be reforms of Parental responsibility in the cases of accidental or unwanted pregnancy right and so you keep negotiating all these all these points and that's what I'm trying to get to okay so I have shown that we can we can have nuanced discussions because if you read this whole thing I'm not going to read it to you um there there is the possibility to have nuanced discussions from a particular perspective with gpt3 but this is still not good enough so now we need a way to generate even more nuanced perspectives and I figured that out so rather than having scalars which is like just a number of you know like one to ten because that's not a semantic thing and gpt3 is a language model it's not a numbers model so I basically just switched it to um to uh words right I am mildly selfish instead of like one or two or three um it's just I'm mildly selfish or whoops um or extremely generous or whatever and so by using these descriptive words by using these adjectives extremely stubborn I'm extremely authoritarian um I am extremely old right um and by generating these uh there's like so each each one of these um has like six possible things because there's mildly moderately and extremely and then there's the positive and negative side so you know I'm extremely selfish or I'm extremely generous so you got six uh for each of these and I think there's 28 dimensions of Personality or 30 or something so you multiply that out and there's a whole bunch of of combinations on top of the basic demographics like education gender genetic population so rather than saying race race or ethnicity I just like what is what is your genetic background um because you know race and ethnicity it's like from a social perspective it matters you know from the shape of your nose and the color of your skin and stuff um you know like you look at me I'm bald I got a big nose like and my last name Shapiro you know what genetic population I come from um and then you know occupation religion sexuality so these are these are some basic demographics you pick and choose from those but then the personality right okay so then um here is here is the long detailed essay about myself and my life story so this is creating a judgment-free Persona which gpt3 seems like it's okay it's it's it's um pretty good at um so stubborn extremely critical moderately spiritual okay so I was born in a small town in sub-Saharan Africa my parents were both production workers and we lived in a modest home I had a choppy heiled happy childhood despite the fact that my parents were often working long hours I was curious and loved to explore my surroundings I'm also very spiritual my family would go to the local temple As I Grew Older I became more critical because remember the extremely critical I began to see the inequalities that existed between different groups of people as it became very stubborn and often refused to do things they didn't agree with however I was also very thoughtful and would spend time considering different points of view um as I entered more entered adulthood I became more interested in politics I began to see the world in terms of political systems and ideologies I also became more Progressive in My Views and began to support equality for all people so this is well I probably need to fix this because it says extremely authoritarian and then moderately Progressive um so those are kind of at odds with each other and again the model is kind of aligned to be more Progressive in general and so it's ignoring the authoritarianism and just saying I'm Progressive um so we'll fix that however also became more apolitical and began to distance myself from the political system um so yeah I've got a bunch of uh politics things here so like like has authoritarian views but is Progressive in apolitical um mildly egalitarian mildly racist you know simple things um and this is also a first first pass um but so this one this person became apolitical okay today I'm a genderqueer female who is bisexual I'm also Sikh and my family still practices this religion I'm currently working in production and I am also pursuing a post-secondary education I'm old but I'm still very curious and interested in learning new things I'm also very collectivist I believe that we're all connected and should um work together to make the world a better place okay cool so moderately collectivist moderately competitive and if you run this a few times you'll get a different life story every time um okay so with that being said um I've got this let me zoom in a little bit um actually properties 28. there we go okay so then uh python generate personas so I've got a quick little script that will just barf out a bunch of these personas and so you can just grab any one of them and um plug it in and see what kind of story gives you and so this mostly Works whoops okay so we got a new we got a new profile skilled trade non-binary North African occupation life physical and social science oh I got the list of occupations from the BLS um so Bureau of Labor and statistics um and that is how I um got a list of like the top categories of of um occupations okay let's turn the temperature up so it's a little bit more creative um and go from there there we go oh interesting middle child of three girls my parents are moderate means and we struggle to make ends meet um okay often teased for being poor I didn't have many friends growing up and I was always a bit of an outsider see very different story when I was 16 my family moved to United States it was culture shock we didn't know anyone and we didn't speak the language I was homesick despite the challenges I was determined to make the best of it I studied hard and learned English also rolled enrolled into a trade school I eventually found my job and started to make a life for myself now in my early 20s so the um mildly young yep now in my early 20s and I'm doing well I have my own place and a good job I'm also in a relationship with a wonderful man and I am happy with my life and grateful for the opportunities that have come my way so you see this is a very different thing like the person is not critical um you know but let's see extremely flexible so that um extremely forgiving um my only mildly critical extremely incurious not really curious about the world um extremely secular and so on okay so um very different perspective and so what we can do is we can have these um these different profiles and then we can feed in feed it into the um the issue that I was talking about so what we're going to do so I've got 10 personas here that I just generated and now what we want to do is make their stories so I will copy I'll probably pause this because this is this is more more High Concepts than coding so I'll pause the video real quick and I'll write another script that will just Autumn automate this part of getting generating the story so we'll be right back okay take two so what this is doing is it's um it's taking that prompt that I just showed you there we go um and generating stories so we're getting people stories um I never had what you call a normal childhood I was always different and I knew it um Eastern European immigrants and my parents always expected me to excel um well this person uh this person had a had a rough time rebellious streak pushing boundaries testing limits continued into my teen realized I was trans at 16. I'm hugely confusing the secret became a huge source of anxiety um now in my early 20s I have come to terms with my identity um yeah excellent so part of uh part of um let's see I think anxious was uh yeah so whether someone is anxious or calm that's on here um but yeah so we're generating um decent stories about people now um let's see small town in North Africa yep drop out of school perfect um let's see there we go also have a very high sex drive I'm often engaged in promiscuous and Casual Sex excellent I can be quite unkind and even violent okay this person is uh this person's a real character this is very selfish and critical um yep I have always felt stifled and oppressed and long to be free um yeah this is this is good so we're getting we're getting very diverse perspectives and so then the last part of this is going to be feeding these stories into the issue of abortion um and then of course I'll make it so that you can just have any particular thing so I've already got the prompt here where it's like here's the story and then you give it a um then you give it a problem um you know so there'll be several phases to this though because there's there's how I feel there's um there's what I want you know what are what are the things that I'm concerned about um that sort of thing so we'll do a little bit of prompt engineering there um actually this is probably almost done now that's very long wow okay uh let's see so let's come in and grab one of these stories some of them are quite long I bet they ran out of tokens because I have it set to a thousand yeah okay so hmm yeah yeah that's too long all right I'll pause and fix something and I'll be right back okay so here's what I did um I had a function that I was playing around with that would keep going until it got really long responses and it would select the longest response it's not necessarily a good thing for any given output there's an optimal length so what I've done is I turn the temperature up high so that you get more creativity more variability but that means sometimes it stops real quick and sometimes it just keeps rambling so what I did is I just did a real quick while true Loop and so it'll generate stories and if the length of the story is greater than a thousand characters and less than two thousand that's kind of The Sweet Spot so then let's see it might be taking a minute I wonder if it's a oh whoops oh wait no it's it should be generating them so uh looks like no there we go yeah that should be good is it filling up stories there we go so it took a minute um but again this is this is what happens when you have high temperature so I'll go ahead and pause it and uh we'll be right back okay so now we've got 10 stories that are pretty good um let's see small town in North Africa so there seems to be a strong preference for for North Africa um I can do a little bit of work on um on balancing the mix there's also a strong preference in this batch for Trends so let me just show you real quick how I how I generated those it's not that I am trying to bias the system um but let's see we open so there's three sexual orientations so heterosexual homosexual bisexual figure that's good enough to cover the whole Spectrum um at least throwing a big blanket over it and then for um gender expression there's CIS male female trans male female gender queer male female and non-binary male female that might be too much I don't know um but again the the goal is to is to make sure that every every major group gets representation um and that's the point is is it's super easy you just if you want to do experiments you come in and update these trait profiles and then rerun the generate personas because that's what it does it takes education occupation religion that sort of thing um homeschooling so whatever whatever skill level that and so on and so forth okay so point is we've got a bunch of stories um and genetic population um did I forget India I totally forgot India that is a huge genetic population um Indian so again I'm not perfect this is just like figuring it out as I go all right so but um oops I should not have closed that um so we've got uh so we've got stories we've got 10 stories so now let's let's um automate the uh the the the part of where we're trying to get issues so we're going to get um so we'll do a topic responses we'll just call it topics and I'll go ahead and pause it again because this will just take a little bit of scripting to Plug and Play a um a prompt and you don't need to see that okay we're just about ready so let me grab this prompt and I'll just show you what it does um all right so this prompt is I'm confronted with a question or issue and I must write how I feel about it I'll write a long extensive opinion about this topic so then we come and grab a story so we'll grab a random story we're in a small town in the middle of nowhere I stumbled upon a book about trans Okay so again same curious person and then we'll get the the topic which I am going to do the abortion one because this is a hot issue especially in well many places um okay so then we have we still have the high temperature detailed essay on how I feel about this um so this you'll frequently get like I'm opposed to this bill um yeah okay so that's fine um but so that we have we have an opinion we have a feeling but we need a little bit more we also need like what are the specific concerns because part of consensus is you have to surface all of the actual objective issues right like what are what are the key things what are the the the the detailed concerns and and it often has to come out as a conversation um I don't know if I'm going to get to conversation this time because we're already at 30 minutes or so um but at least I want to get this far um and then try and decompose each position a little bit more um okay so I like this but let's see instead of feelings because emotions are critical um people's emotional disposition is a part of consensus but now we have to be objective I confronted with a question or issue and I must write um write about uh let's see right out my specific objective concrete concerns um what are the material uh consequences um or issues involved okay so now we're going to change the prompt pretty dramatically detailed essay on um my concrete concerns okay so now let's see how this changes we're leaving everything else the same okay Force many women into poverty um yeah okay cool so we can have this prompt that just says okay what's what are the what are the objective concerns here so let's go ahead and save this out and we'll do profile I did not mean to cover to delete that I do profile and topic and so theoretically with a little bit of fine-tuning and prompt engineering because so fine-tuning um what I what how I would approach this is um I'd get real stories from real people and their opinions um you'd probably need in order to get you'd need a lot of diversity in the fine-tuning data but you get enough stories about real people and their takes on these issues and then you get the model will generalize and be able to realize like okay we need to take someone's life story into account when when um doing this okay so we'll say topic um let's see uh concrete okay there we go and then finally um the so part is part is a brainstorming right um a big part of consensus is there's how you feel about it there are your objective concerns um but then there's also the creative part the the the Reaching Forward and and what's called bridging which is like okay what are the places that we can find Common Ground um so here we say okay I'm confronted with with a issue and I must write out my um so instead of concerns I must um brainstorm ideas um about uh Creative Solutions to the problem um the goal is to discover um let's see discover um let's see I guess areas um where um or let's see discover compromises that uh can satisfy everyone's needs so the goal with consensus is uh not to make everyone happy but to get to a place where where you find something that that everyone can live with okay so detailed essay um we'll say let's see detailed brainstorm on creative compromises and so in a formal system if something like this were to be implemented for helping guide politics or God forbid to replace politicians um generating ideas is is a whole other process so consensus is broken into several steps and we're kind of making a shorthand but again this video is getting long and I just want to get at least this far so that you see where I'm going with it and then once we can I'll probably work on this a little bit behind the scenes and once we can reliably generate realistic opinions for you know an arbitrary number of people you know I'm only doing 10. but the idea here is let's let's come up with a system that allows us to find find compromise and consensus with 10 billion people that's my goal um okay I never think big um let's see okay so some some things is we could negotiate another option would be a set set up safe legal and affordable abortion services in other countries um therefore would still be able to access them even if they're abandoned my own country so kind of thinking of a contingency plan we could also try and educate the public on this importance and safety okay and finally we could set up underground networks of safe and affordable abortions going rogue I love it okay so we take all of these these different aspects of someone's world view let's save this as a as a thing um because you know what if someone is opposed to abortion and they don't know what's happening does it really hurt them no I shouldn't think this way um but part of the part of the thing about consensus is If This Were Ever to be implemented as a government system anonymity would be very important because like you might be talking about an issue that is currently illegal so say for instance like I don't smoke pot but I believe that that it should be fully legal because all the science indicates that marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol in many respects um and I want to in order to have a safe effective conversation I need to trust that like if I were to have a conversation with a machine or give my opinions to a machine that's gonna you know churn and crank out that that data is not going to be used against me later because you know authoritarian regimes not not just do that presently but have done that forever is any public records about someone can be used against them this was a huge thing during the Holocaust was stuff as simple as Library records land records Deeds were used to root out undesirable people in um in Nazi Germany I'm so glad that I demonetized my own video because I'm talking about like rape and Nazi Germany and stuff and like I totally get demonetized at this point but you know what this is science and we can't be afraid of taboo topics um so then we'll say topic and we'll say compromise Okay so we've got three aspects of of some of the conversations that you need to have for consensus and obviously this is just basic prompt engineering this is in order to do this right we would need to collect you know hundreds thousands tens of thousands of these discussions from real people to get real human examples um fortunately though gpd3 was trained on internet data which means it has already read a lot of real human um uh real human opinions and that is actually the point of having the story right because you it reads someone's story and it'll cue up all of those embeddings about people like that that it has already read about and so we're getting somewhat accurate-ish representations of what someone might actually want or think obviously I'm using the instruct models and so it's already kind of it's already biased towards a particular data set which is not ideal but if I fine-tune the base model base DaVinci we'll get rid of that anyways okay so I think we've got those three prompts um yeah so I'll pause it again and I'll make a third script that will take those stories and this this topic um actually I've got it here the generate responses so I'll just finish fleshing this out and it will save everyone's opinions and we'll be right back and we'll call it a day because we are at 40 minutes okay so we are running this let me show you the script real quick so it's just very simple um runs those three prompts in serial where it gets someone's feelings their concerns and then asks for compromises um so this is a very shorthand form of um of consensus and then it saves it out to World Views so we've got we at the start of someone's world view is structured information where it has um their story uh so like this is kind of like this is who the person is um and then here are you know there's um the world view is a list of responses to topics so there's a topic and then how they feel about it and the concerns and then the compromises that they want to do and so what we'll do is in the future when I come back to this I'll take all of this information and I'll run this for a few more people the reason I'm only doing it on 10 people is because I don't want to burn through tokens while just testing to make sure that the thing is valid but really ultimately like I want to do this for you know tens of thousands of people um because then you can really get get creative and what we're doing is we're provoking a lot of creativity from the machine um so yeah uh there we go um I think that's about it I'll just let this finish um but we'll call it a day and we've got a system now that is taking someone's um you know their life story and using that to uh to generate their position and so what we'll do is we have a lot of data and so then the next thing that we'll do is we will take all of these dispositions and we'll try and find okay what's the common ground can we have the machine calculate what is the common ground that people can agree on and what are some Creative Solutions and we'll have a machine that takes this as the input and and as a very clinical thing kind of tries to come up with Alternatives and proposals but yeah thanks for watching I think we'll call that a day um and uh have a good one
