morning everybody it is five in the morning and i don't want to be awake but my brain had uh other ideas okay so today's state of the industry uh address is going to be about yan lacoon and specifically this paper that he put out a couple months ago back in june so what september august july june so about four months ago uh three and a half months ago um okay it says a path towards autonomous machine intelligence so he doesn't call it artificial general intelligence he calls it autonomous machine intelligence and looking at this he talks about one of my favorite topics cognitive architecture so yeah there you go keyword cognitive architecture now one thing i will say is that you know he just comes right out and says this document is not a technical nor scholarly paper but it's a position paper okay so it's not technical there's no code there's a little bit of math and some diagrams but the overall thing is he's basically proposing what is this this is a biomimetic cognitive architecture and you see how there's all these little interlinks and stuff what does this look like this looks like a microservices diagram or a wiring diagram now one thing is that you see how there's all these cross crosslinks and interconnections that's great and all but i have to say that um that my uh my design is a little bit simpler because that's what this is all about um yeah so this work is a little bit less sophisticated than my book however um i am happy to see that a major name in the industry so young lacoon is uh presently the chief ai scientist at meta um so you know like this is this is legit um but yeah it's a little less less sophisticated um he has fewer components and they're not as well organized see version 0.9 um but yeah so like what are the what are the high high level takeaways um so he's got the idea of a configurator short term memory world model perception actor two big things that are missing from this one is the agent model and two is cognitive control so he doesn't really have like there's no long-term memory which like you just search for um sore cognitive architecture and do an image search like this has long-term memory right and this is a much older um let's see where's like symbolic working memory procedurals uh yeah symbolic long-term memories um so like okay we're reinventing the wheel again um which that's that's been my chief complaint about um about uh the state of agi research is there is so much work that has been done on um on cognition and neuroscience and cognitive architectures and people are just kind of reinventing the wheel it seems like they haven't done a thorough enough literature review um he does mention kahneman so kahneman talked about system one and system two thinking so one is just you know rapid uh intuitive thinking and the other is um slow deliberate thought which that is exactly what my book is about which is about slow deliberate thought how do you create something that thinks through things and so for instance he talks about um he talks extensively about cost and intrinsic motivations i don't think he proposes any intrinsic motivations i've only skimmed this but i have an entire book about intrinsic motivations i call it benevolent by design um so again like this work is great but it's just it's not quite where it needs to be um still not going quite fast enough um yeah still the right direction so no criticism there um but yeah he talked extensively about like um intrinsic cost energetic cost i wonder if he talks about risk he minim he he says minimize risk once okay uh so that um why is that bad uh if you don't have an agent that thinks about risk to itself or others that much um i mean i guess if i have to spell out why that's bad okay that's fine um anyways take a look at it yourself um it's uh let's see i think it's about 62 pages before it breaks into all the citations um maybe a little bit let's see yeah so there we end so 47 it's only 47 pages of of text there's no code no examples no uh actual technological experiments nothing like that um i have all of that in my book i actually have demonstrations um and and actual like real world like hey this is the thing that actually that a machine can actually do and if you want even more look at my uh first book on ai natural language cognitive architecture so anyways check out the link in the comments this is this is a legit dude and i am happy that someone on twitter sent me this link because it is going in the right direction but yeah state of the industry thanks for watching
