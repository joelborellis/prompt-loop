hey everybody let's start with a demo um i want to show you why i'm doing all of this i had a conversation recently and i realized that a lot of people are new to my work and what i'm doing so let me show you why i'm doing this um we're gonna fire up starting up i am now fully online raven how can i help hey raven um i'm having a problem with my house can you help me out i will be happy to help what seems to be the problem um well my kitchen is on fire what should i do i would suggest calling the fire department i'm not trained to handle situations like this uh that's a good point okay i'll call them thanks you're welcome is there anything else i can help you with well now that i've left my house i need somewhere to stay what should i do i don't know how to find a hotel let me see what i can do i will search for a hotel in the area and see if they have any vacancies well i don't think you can give me any phone numbers how do i find one should i google it how do i know if it's a good hotel you can't give out any phone numbers as for finding a hotel you can search for one on google or you can ask your friends for recommendations you can also look for reviews online once you find a hotel that you like you can call them to confirm the room is available oh okay that makes sense all right well i found a new problem my car won't start what should i do your car won't start that's not good i'm not qualified to give you advice on that but i'm sure there are plenty of people out there who can help you you can search for a mechanic online or you can ask your friends for recommendations hopefully they can help you good luck all right well i don't have any money so i really need your help when i turn the key it just clicks what does that mean that's not good i'm not an expert on cars but i'm sure there are plenty of people out there who can help you you can search for okay that's that's enough of a demonstration you see what i'm working on um so let me give you a little bit of background um a lot of you folks are new to my channel and you don't know that i've written two books on this topic um so natural language cognitive architecture is the my prototype of a particular type of agi they call artificial cognitive entity it's based on natural language processing the reason is because highest our our highest level thought our highest level abstract of abstraction is in language um and so therefore language is a really great tool to use to um to approximate human thought planning and so on um so for instance we are able to encode very high level concepts very easily um you know say i want to get to the moon right that's just a few words and it gives you a very very clear idea of like what your big objective is um ultimately the goal is well we're going to have machines that are more intelligent than us one day and in some respects uh tools like gpt3 already are more intelligent than us in some ways not always and so the font my follow-up book was benevolent by design which is how do we build a machine that is going to be intrinsically trustworthy um that is my goal uh my my my platform that i'm that i'm creating is called raven or real-time uh real-time uh assistant vastly extensible network so what i've just done is i've given you a demonstration of the mvp of raven so mvp is minimum viable product so basically that means this is the this is the very first version of raven that is you know commercially viable right if you had this on your phone um it could be a useful thing um i the the repo is up here and so i'm not going to go and give you a deep dive of like well actually no i guess i guess i kind of am i was going to say i'm not going to give you a deep dive of how it works but that's really the point of this um so the readme file kind of outlines what is raven raven is a general purpose voice-enabled ai companion now i need to point out that ai companions are not presently approved by openai so this is for experimentation only this is not something that i'm going to try and get approved for for commercial deployment just yet it needs a lot of testing fortunately open ai does allow i think it's up to 10 or 15 testers and i've got that covered so fortunately i'm not accepting any people to apply to be testers i've got plenty of testers already so the ultimate goal of raven is to be an information companion like cortana from halo and there's plenty of other examples there's fictional examples like um the the movie her with joaquin phoenix um that was a great example there's a joie from um or joy from uh from blade runner 1849 another example but the key thing is we need to create something that is going to be benevolent by design something that will be trustworthy so how do we do that from my perspective there are three steps or three stages to that so first is we have to earn user trust through data privacy security reliability and utility it has to be useful right you have to get use out of it and it also has to be reliable you have to you have to be able to reliably get good advice and good direction from an ai tool or an artificial cognitive entity in order for it to earn your trust so once we start there it then has to demonstrate the ability to sell monitor self-check and self-correct so these are all just different components of self-improvement um but basically self-monitoring is something that we humans do so like you know everyone who has social anxiety it's because you're hyper vigilant you're self-monitoring right um if you uh but everyone self-monitors to a certain to a certain degree um and the self-monitoring is monitoring your own behavior and your own thoughts to make sure that you're adhering to some principles or goal and we'll get to those principles in a minute but they're outlined in this book and then in order to self-check so self-monitoring is before you act self-check is is when you check okay did my action have the tended result yes or no and then if it didn't you self-correct so say for instance you're at a party and you say i'm gonna tell a joke so you're you you think about the joke that you're gonna tell and then you say it and then you you know ideally everyone laughs right everyone's like oh that was a real knee slapper or whatever and so then you self-check people did what you expected them to do you did right so you've got a positive fine-tuning data point you know in your head but if you tell a joke and everyone's like that was cringe you're like i didn't do so good that time did i so that's what i mean by self-check and self-correction is given those data points of successes and failures how do you integrate that and behave better in the future that is and that is coming in the roadmap for raven um and then finally once we have these first two things which is trust through privacy security reliability and utility and then we master self-improvement which so self-improvement with with artificial cognition is largely a data problem but it can also be a coding problem and we'll get into all that in the future so then have earned your trust raven should eventually be granted autonomy so what do i mean by autonomy um you know everyone's afraid of skynet materializing one day and killing everyone right that's that's what we're afraid of we're afraid of the machine getting autonomy and then deciding to kill us well if we get ahead of the curve and we design something that is benevolent by design that is reliable and safe and has demonstrated that it adheres to principles that we trust and appreciate then it can be granted some control over itself right in stages so say for instance um you know how like you can install venmo on your phone and then your phone becomes a financial utility raven will be no different that's where the vast extensible network comes in um where there's going to be functionality that you had to raven so let's just say that in the future in five or ten years there's venmo for raven so you say hey raven install venmo and then you say okay hey raven i want you to take care of my bills from now on and raven will say okay i'll take care of your bills from now on i've installed venmo and now i can handle your finances um so that's what i mean by granting some autonomy and then over time and this will take many many years uh make no mistake i'm talking about 20 to 50 plus years because we're going to need to demonstrate this reliability over many many years and possibly multiple generations to see how far it goes but the future is coming it's closer than you think um so for this mvp there's two primary features one is that it is voice enabled um which you just heard um and then it can cover multiple domains and topics um i just gave a couple like hands-on examples where i you know showed like hey i'm having my life is a disaster apparently the kitchen is on fire my car won't start i can't find a hotel um you know so on and so forth um this uh repo it includes um relatively detailed instructions on how to get this set up um i just went through it myself because i had reinstalled my computer so i had to do all this from scratch these instructions work the hardest part is signing up for the google google cloud api stuff um fortunately though this is such low bandwidth that i have in all my testing i have spent a grand total of 11 cents on on on text-to-speech and speech-to-text services from google um so it's very cheap the more expensive part is open ai which you'll need to fine-tune the model all that is here so then let's talk about the fine-tuning data that i used for this so right now this does not have a cognitive architecture i talked about cognitive architecture but really this is super simple let me show you let's just go over the code real quick um do to do raven mvp let's zoom in so this is a grand total of 227 sorry 226 lines of code um it is not that complicated um there's here's the main loop right here where all it does is it listens to the microphone until speech is returned from the api um so it'll just wait and then it'll uh it will give you um it'll append that to the conversation so it'll accumulate the conversation um in a uh in a list um and then it listens for if you're going to end the conversation which there's just a few static catch phrases so this is what you'd call a user intent so this is where the extensibility will come in in the future is every time you say something raven will check for your intent are you intending to you know add a calendar entry are you telling raven something that's going to happen in the future are you asking raven to change its behavior right that's something that we need to say like if you say raven i don't like it when you talk to me like that can you talk a different way that's something that we want it to be able to integrate and learn so then we have a phase of of detecting user intent and then we use the fine-tuned model to generate a response so it's just input process output this is one loop um so this is not the full cognitive architecture which let me show you what that looks like so the full cognitive architecture has two loops uh there's the in there's the outer loop which is what i just showed you which is input processing and output right now it only has a microphone in the future raven will have microphones it'll have cameras all sorts of things i've started working on a smart home device so that like raven will live on your wall and and it's got a touch screen and so raven can watch you and observe you but if you have an ai thing that's watching you 24 7 you want to make damn sure that that data is secure right um so there's there's this uh there's this thing called fully homomorphic encryption which means the data that it records about you can be fully encrypted and raven can still use that data but that data can never be exfiltrated so that's another problem we gotta work on and then the other thing that i've been working on is um is the inner loop which is kind of the inner thoughts where raven will be thinking without speaking and so i've got a whole list of experiments and it was not obvious but if you've been watching my channel you'll know that like oh i'm working on a artificial cognition and i'm working on the inner loop so the inner loop here is this so i'm working on that separately and then i've got this long term chat with external sources that is this part where there's going to be a shared database and raven will be able to pull data from external sources like wikipedia or google so that is another component of raven the long-term chat so this is the goldfish memory problem recursive summarizer and empty document answering these are all different cognitive tasks that are going to be integrated into raven eventually and this diagram is kind of the ultimate cognitive architecture okay so now you're up to speed as to what i'm working on and why so let's dive back into so i showed you the code this is the mvp you heard it it works you can talk to it um there are limitations though like if you ask raven hey what did we talk about yesterday it's not going to do that it doesn't have long-term memory yet and also you heard where raven's like let me look that up for you in an ideal world raven will be able to do that but raven doesn't have any apis to the outside world yet so again mvp still has a lot of work to do but let's talk about the fine tuning data and also let me do a quick time check only 14 minutes we're fine okay so the fine tuning data is here um and so this is this is another thing is um open source this is under the mit license and as far as unless something changes this will always be under the mit license because in order for this to be trustworthy it needs to be 100 transparent and so for instance in the future when raven has internal thoughts all of those internal thoughts are going to be recorded in plain text just like these logs you have the input and output and there's going to be other logs where where you can see raven's thoughts in plain english right it's not going to be obfuscated behind you know math or anything else it's got to be fully transparent so everything that raven thinks says does every decision is going to be recorded in plain english there's not going to be the only black box is the model in the back end but it's so segmented and um and and split into microservices that no single model which you know each individual model is a black box all right like with a conversational model that's a black box but you can see what the input was as well as the output that's all going to be recorded and logged and so it can be monitored by meta services or metacognitive services and that's another thing that i'm working on where raven there will be there will be modules in raven's head that are monitoring raven's thoughts to make sure that raven is thinking correctly um so that's all stuff that i'm working on um but let's look at the training data real quick whoops um so the training data for the fine for the conversation module is right here it's raven.jsonl um let's choose language json okay so um let's do view uh whoops zoom restore default that's way too small okay so this was this was created from let's see over 600 different synthesized conversations um these conversations range from um i'm having trouble with my mother-in-law she won't respect my boundaries too you know why is titanium dioxide white right um and so these training examples uh are centered around two primary principles um which i've got listed in the um in the down here in the about the fine tuning data so there are there are two primary things one is compassionate listening excuse me i don't know why i have hiccups so one is compassionate listening which you heard like when i was talking with raven it's like oh that sounds like it's really stressful that's what compassionate listening is it's also called reflective listening um and then there's also curiosity about the about the user but there's the three higher principles and this is what i mentioned earlier so this is what this book is all about um six words that safeguard humanity or three principles three core objective functions or what i call now heuristic imperatives because core objective functions is a little bit of a misnomer but heuristic comparatives are what are what raven abides by so number one is reduce suffering of the user in the long run raven will want to reduce suffering for everyone but reduced suffering of the user if raven detects any opportunity to help the user feel better it will take it so you know it's like hey raven i'm really stressed out because my my kitchen is on fire it's like okay let's fix that problem another second here is to comparative is increase prosperity of the user to prosper means to live well which raven will support by helping the user to navigate relationships life and work right so on the one hand we all want to move away from suffering right that is literally the evolutionary purpose of having a nervous system that's why we can detect when we're hungry tired cold when we're wounded that is the point of a nervous system is so that we can survive longer right suffering misery pain those are signals those are evolutionary signals to push us away from dying right but we're if we get away from dying okay great but where are we heading towards right it's a spectrum so you're moving away from suffering and towards prosperity which means so what does prosperity look like prosperity means that you're going to be happy that you have abundance that you have safety and security that you have support love friends that you have meaningful hobbies and so that is that those first two functions raven will push you away from suffering which is a proxy for death um and will push you towards a state of prosperity which means happiness abundance living well um a life of purpose and then the third thing is increase understanding of the user which means that raven will teach you right um a huge chunk of raven's training data is about answering those questions to help you understand the world and yourself better so those three principles are how raven thinks and how raven will earn your trust over time because remember up here at the very beginning we said what are we going to do we're going to be reliable and have utility and so by by having three simple rules you can talk to raven eventually the the current the mvp doesn't have it but um eventually you'll be able to talk to raven about its goals and why it decided to tell you something right because that explainability is part of that transparency actually you know what i should probably add transparency on here trust through data privacy security transparency anyways so point being is that by having these three simple rules everyone who uses raven will understand this is raven's goal and and having having uh understanding what raven's goals are what raven's principles are will help you to trust it and understand why raven does what it does um later versions of raven will explicitly adhere to these three core objective functions right now they're just implicitly baked into the training data so at no point in the training data will you see the core objective functions well you see the heroes to comparatives it is implicit based on what um but based on the how this training data was created so in the future once we move to the full cognitive architecture those core objective functions will be baked in into the inner loop which is raven will explicitly think okay is this user suffering how do i fix that is this user does this user need to increase their prosperity how do i help them get a better job how do i help them make friends right or what is what is the user not understanding how do i help them understand now another thing is that since raven is a machine raven raven is not capable of suffering or doing well raven doesn't care right understanding however is the one function that raven shares with the users and and everyone else but also itself because raven will be intrinsically curious so one of my one of my most popular videos of all time on youtube actually is that curiosity function i'm so fine tuning gpt3 to generate question questions about everything this was one of the most important functions for realizing a a an autonomous cognitive architecture which is it needs to generate questions internally so spontaneous internal questions are one of the most important things that sets humans apart from every other animal now many animals are curious right crows ravens those are those are curious animals polar bears are curious dolphins are curious they'll go investigate things um but humans are the only ones that will ask how do i do that and it will and humans will will formulate very sophisticated experiments to deliberately model the whole world there's a book that i'm reading called the pattern seekers that goes over this in great detail so anyways the point being is everything that you see me doing on youtube speaks to this goal of creating raven which is an artificial cognitive entity one that should earn our trust over time and then eventually be safe enough to be autonomous um okay i think that's about it um i do have some notes on cognitive architecture and future uh iterations of raven like where are we going um there are quite a few open problems hence why i'm always making these youtube videos about solving different cognitive tasks you know i always talk about the books that i read to help me with this because this is this is very much biomimetic everything that i've learned about neuroscience cognition psychology gets poured into raven um so the the top three problems and the each of these problems is multifaceted and can be broken down into sub problems but the first problem is cognitive control so cognitive control is about executive function or staying on task so how do you keep raven on task how do you keep raven or how do you allow raven to task switch appropriately because like let's say you know you're talking with raven about doing laundry and then raven hears like your smoke alarm go off you don't want raven to stay stuck on doing the laundry if your house is on fire you need to task switch and you know you as a human you need to task switch but raven also needs to task switch but also you don't want to task switch inappropriately right um another component of cognitive control is to design cognitive tasks for itself so say for instance you say um this was an example that came from my discord server someone was saying okay what if you talk to your ai companion and you say like oh who did i piss off last year that is a really complex problem to solve because what does it mean to piss someone off right and then so raven will have to design a cognitive task to go back through all of its memories and and and evaluate those memories for that result of okay when did dave talk about someone was mad at him or when did someone tell dave like i didn't like it when you said that right so that's that's what i mean by designing a cognitive task so that means going back through memories and performing different cognitive operations on those memories as one example another cognitive task is planning for the future right how do you brainstorm what to do in the future and then lastly you need to measure progress towards goals or towards success which that is also a non-trivial problem in fact human goal tracking is another thing that sets us apart from from most animals is that the time horizon for most animals even the smartest animals like ravens and dolphins their their time horizon for task success is very short they think only you know minutes into the future humans we can think decades into the future that is unique to humans and we need to reproduce that that ability in in raven in artificial cognitive entities um a second problem is model of self and abilities so you heard in the example where raven's like let me look up a hotel for you raven doesn't know what raven can do right now raven has no model of self raven has no ego it's just an input output mechanism in order for it to be an entity it actually has to have a knowledge of itself how it operates what it's capable of and what it's not capable of right in order to like so for instance that speaks to self-correction and self-checking raven will ultimately need a model of itself so that it can have an identity so that it can have the ability to say i know what i am and this is what i'm capable of and these are my boundaries and constraints and then lastly self-monitoring self-checking and self-correction i talked about the principles the the the heuristic imperatives so these are the guiding principles that it will check against but then we still need to work out the actual code and data to allow it to do that right so you know words are one thing but then the code is another um and i'm working on all this i know this sounds like you know pie in the sky stuff but a lot of this is closer to being realized than you might think okay i think that's it i'm going to call it there this was a lot um let me know what questions you have and also if you want me to do this full time please like and subscribe the video and consider supporting me on patreon because if i get to a threshold where i can do this full time i absolutely will and i think the world will benefit from it so thanks for watching
