hey everyone david shapiro here with another video we're going to talk boundaries and consent with gpd3 i'm trying a new format of video where i use um gpthree as a way to help teach um things that i want to teach the world but also at the same time i'll teach you how to use gpt3 okay what is the definition of a boundary let's see what it says a boundary is a line that marks the limits of an area okay that's a boundary let's change this to say personal boundary what is a personal boundary is thinking thinking thinking a personal boundary is a line that delineates what is and is not acceptable in terms of physical and emotional intimacy perfect okay i like that um what is the definition of consent consent is an agreement between two people to gauge in sexual activity okay um what is the let's say full definition of consent okay it is clearly been um contaminated by the previous thing so uh let's see consent is voluntary enthusiastic and ongoing agreement to engage in sexual activity it is important to remember that consent can be withdrawn at any time okay this is all true but this is not the full definition of consent so let's remove that and i'll show you how what was above it the full definition can is agreement to do something see how the definition changes drastically let me copy that and then do go back a little bit oh it doesn't require keep it okay so anyways you can see that uh what you write beforehand changes the next output okay write a formal definition of consent okay yeah consent is an agreement to do something it is given voluntarily and with knowledge of what is being agreed to okay cool that is a good broad definition of consent write a formal definition of a personal boundary a personal boundary is a line that separates one person from another it is a limit on how close one person can get physically or emotionally great um okay uh write a summary of the book let's see write a brief summary of the book the power of a positive no by william hurry uh he uh let's see in the power of a positive no william murray provides readers with a seven step process for saying no effectively he argues that the ability to say no is a critical skill for anyone who wants to be successful in life or he offers readers specific strategies for handling difficult conversations setting boundaries and maintaining relationships the book also includes case studies and real world examples to illustrate the principles uri discusses okay yeah i would say that's that's fine the only thing is that i don't necessarily agree with the seven step process because he actually outlines a three-step process which is yes no yes um explain uri's yes no yes method for establishing boundaries let's see it involves saying no to a request but then following up with a positive response for example if someone asks you to do something you don't want to do you can say no but then offer an alternative suggestion yes that is correct this method can be used to maintain relationships while setting clear boundaries perfect okay so taking a big step back we defined boundaries earlier as a you know a line that should not be crossed [Music] and then we also defined consent as something that you is agreed to why is consent important in work relationships let's see consent is important in work relationships because it establishes a clear and mutual understanding of expectations roles and boundaries it helps to prevent misunderstandings and can make communication and collaboration more efficient and effective when all parties involved in a work relationship have given their consent it can uh help create a more positive and productive work environment yes 100 percent i think that everyone in any kind of professional capacity should understand consent that's me personally um how does this relate to consensus so this is something that i use both in my personal life and in my work life whenever i'm conducting a meeting i don't ever like you know tell people this is the conclusion agree with me i ask people um what they believe and why and we work towards consensus i'm always open to being wrong now more often than not you know i come into a meeting with some preconceived ideas and we talk through it and sometimes you know the group comes to consensus that my idea was right sometimes that's not always true though sometimes i go into a meeting and i say like i have no clue what i'm doing so anyways let's see how how consent and consensus are related consensus is a process of reaching agreement between different parties in order to achieve consensus all parties involved must be willing to compromise and negotiate this process can be difficult but it is important in work relationships in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page and everyone agrees with the final decision so consent and consensus have a very similar meaning um let's say compare and contrast the words consent and consensus um consensus explore their etymologies and roots as well as their colloquial um usage and everyday and semantic meanings and it's thinking the word consent comes from the word constantire which means to feel together the word consensus comes from the latin word consensum which means agreement both words are used to refer to a situation in which two or more parties agree on something however consent is often used to refer to a situation where one party agrees to do something while consensus is often used to refer to a situation where our all parties have involved the sorry which all parties involved agreed to do something um yes so the implication there is consent is often between two parties uh whereas consensus is between many parties again you know i don't know if that's perfect but it did a really good job doing this very quickly let's see how might the issue of consent come up between romantic partners in a non-sexual context what are some examples where a couple may need to discuss consent okay so one example might be if one partner wants to move in together and the other partner is not sure if they are ready another example might be if one partner wants to have a child and the other partner is not sure if they are ready yeah um you know you consent to um you know live together you consent to have a child those are really important things to talk about and consent to because remember one of the definitions of consent is an informed agreement let's see what are some examples where consent might be important between friends and other um i'll just say friends friends or social groups okay so it says one example is one one person wants to borrow money and the other is not comfortable with it another example might be if one friend wants to share a secret with another friend and the other friend is not sure if they're ready to hear it yes so that's a perfect example if if so i have a personal policy i say if you do not want you know if you if it's a secret do not tell me i don't want to know because i don't want the burden of keeping someone secret i don't consent to hearing someone's secret this is perfect i didn't i had no idea would come up with this but this actually touches on a personal policy that i have um okay so that's consent between romantic partners and friends or social groups i had another idea what was it something consent between um oh good grief okay well anyways you're starting to get the idea oh family members that's what it was that's what it was um finally what are some examples of where consent comes into play between family members there are many examples where consent comes into flame comes between family members one might be when a sibling wants to borrow money okay she's copying itself another example might be if one parent wants to discipline their child in a certain way and the other parent doesn't want to that is perfect okay so taking a big step back what are the difficulties with consent why is consent hard at times let's see what it says um there are many difficulties that can arise with consent especially when it comes to sexual activity the biggest difficulty is one person is significantly more intoxicated than the other okay so it's defaulting to sexual consent um that's not what i meant um let's see let's uh um let's start by just defining consent or let's say let's say um with consent between um let's see at work let's see yes one reason why consent can be hard at times is because people feel like they have to do something to keep their job or to please their boss exactly conflicting interests another reason why consent can be difficult is because people may not want to say or sit want may not want to say no or be seen as difficult yes this is particularly true in some cultures like japan i just watched a video called what was it let's ask shogo um great video i'll link it in the comments or in the description where he talks about how japan japanese culture is very collectivist and they're conditioned to not to stand out additionally people may feel pressured to do something because their colleagues are doing it lastly people may not be aware of what they are consenting to or they may not understand the consequences of their actions again these are all great great reasons why consent can be difficult what i was hoping that it would get to is that the contents of one person's mind might be different from from another but i guess i guess it does say like they might not understand the consequences of their action what about miscommunications how does that affect consent miscommunications can definitely affect consent if someone is not clear about what they are consenting to they may end up doing something they don't want to do or they are not fully aware of the consequences additionally miscommunications could lead to feeling people feeling like they have to do something because they misunderstood what was being asked to them and then in worst cases you can be actively misled um so misleading someone violates their consent misleading is a form of lying or misdirection or whatever um what are some protocols or communication techniques tech can i spell right now techniques there we go techniques that can be used to discuss and establish consent some protocols or communication techniques can be include let's see oh that's a lot i'm asking for consent that can be construed for anything sexual making it clear that consent can be used can withdrawn at any time using clear and concise language when asking for consent checking in to make sure they're comfortable respecting other people's boundaries yes remember boundaries listening to the other person's concerns and taking them seriously being aware of the other person's body language and non-verbal cues making sure that both parties are okay so it's defaulting back to sexual consent so this is this is one case where um gpt3 is very deeply colored by its um by its training data which is a lot of internet data so here i'm talking about consent at work and then i you know the implication is we should be can we should still talk about consent at work but it changes topic to um to sexual consent um let's see let's see what is the definition of interpersonal boundaries let's see write a long thorough definition interpersonal boundaries are the limits we set on other people in our lives defining what is what is and is not acceptable in terms of physical emotional and mental intimacy they vary from person to person and can change over time depending on our relationships and experiences wonderful perfect setting and maintaining healthy boundaries is an important part of self-care and can help us to protect from emotional and physical harm it can also foster respect trust and communication that is true there was a psychology study that i read years ago that said that actually establishing boundaries increases people's respect for you if you tell someone no and stand your ground it actually means that it teaches them that they can't walk all over you and they actually respect you more okay when our boundaries are whoops did not mean that when our boundaries are violated we may feel violated disrespected or unsafe unsafe safety is critical safety is a huge component that is the underlying need for boundaries and consent we may also struggle to assert ourselves and set our limits with others learning to set and respect personal boundaries is a key part of a healthy of healthy development it can be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor if you are struggling to set boundaries in your life personally i read books but yes if you talk to a mental health professional or a life coach about boundaries that would be great um okay give some hypothetical let's see imagine so if you use more specific words gbt3 really picks up on it so like if i say like give hypothetical examples it will like give a list but if i say imagine some scenarios some fictional scenarios where boundaries are being ignored or violated come up with a parable one day a young woman named sarah went to visit her friend jane jane was happy to see sarah and welcomed her into her into her home however sarah did not reciprocate jane's enthusiasm she stood in the doorway not moving to come inside jane asked sarah if she was okay but sarah just stood there not saying a word this is a weird story jane began to feel uncomfortable and asked sarah again if she was sure she was okay sarah still did not respond jane then decided to respect sarah's boundary and stepped back allowing her to enter the house if she wanted to oh interesting okay so by by inaction by inaction um sarah did not give consent or you know you know she she silently established a boundary okay i see what it's trying to say sarah finally came inside but she did not speak her make eye contact with jane jane felt confused and hurt by sarah's behavior um it's important to respect other people's boundaries even if we don't understand them wow this is a great story i'm really happy with this if we don't we risk making them feel disrespected violated or unsafe this is a really great parable um let's see let's delete that and do it start again it should come up with something entirely different i was at the park with my young daughter when a strange man came to a came up to us and started talking to us i didn't feel comfortable with him being so close to us but i didn't want to be rude so i didn't say anything oh let's see it got it looks like it gets bad um didn't feel comfortable with him being so close so i didn't say anything he ended up following us home so i had to call the police to get him to leave um i was at a party with my friends and i got really drunk i started making out with this guy i didn't know very well and ended up going home with him i regretted it the next day when i woke up hung over and realized i had no idea what his name was or where he lived um so yeah uh boundaries again typically turns sexual um let's see let's do this between family members and also i will just compress this this is the previous thing just kind of condense it into one paragraph using vertical a quick lesson about gpt3 using vertical white space is a really good way of telling gpt3 where boundaries are between instructions so speaking of boundaries okay imagine some fictional scenarios where boundaries are being ignored or violated between family members actually let's say by family members come up with a parable mary is always asking her grown daughter for personal questions about her love life even though she knows her daughter is not comfortable discussing such things this violates her daughter's boundary for privacy excellent john's parents always show up unannounced at his apartment oh man if you read reddit this happens so often even though he has asked him to call first this violates his boundary of independence jane's sister always borrows her clothes without asking even though jane has told her not to tim's brother always uses his computer without his permission even though tim has asked him not to okay so yeah ownership property independence and privacy all different kinds of boundaries that you excuse me that you can have um this is really great and it also teaches the importance of boundaries um i'm actually satisfied with this i think that gpt3 has demonstrated a really good understanding of consent and boundaries although it is a little bit frustrating that it defaults to sexual consent and sexual boundaries um consent and boundaries apply to everything in life so i hope that future training sets um understand that and that gbt3 develops more nuanced understanding but still with the correct prompts it seems like it can handle um boundaries and consent perfectly fine thanks for watching
