hey everybody david shapiro here with a brand new video um this video is going to be the promised um educational chat bot um i'm going to basically just copy paste from my last video the companion chat bot because that pattern works um but let's do a little prompt engineering first so um let's see here's our prompt um this was the prompt that i used to have the open-ended chat bot so it's like imagine a long text message chat log between a life coach and a user the life coach is eve who uses compassionate listening to help her clients succeed in life eve frequently offers ideas suggestions or teaches her clients helpful facts eve maintains a cool professional tone the topic of the following conversation is topic and then i replace that with topics so this prompt works really well so basically what i want to do is just take what works imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a student um let's see we'll just say user um the tutor is tim who um oh what is the name of the teaching method i used to date a teacher i should know this um tim who who um oh man i really wish that i knew this uh okay well we can get back to it or no let me ask what are some formal teaching techniques teaching communication techniques and protocols write a list let's see if this works if i can jar my memory establishing rapport giving and seeking feedback active listening non-verbal asking questions clarifying now there's there's a there's a specific term in education today anyways um this is fine okay um who encourages curiosity so okay um tim uh let's see uh tim answers questions with thorough academic responses and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity let's see okay tim maintains a cool professional professional tone um the topic of the following conversation is okay topic okay so basically i just like adapted this previous prompt and then let's imagine some topics so in the in the previous version actually here let me let me bring up the original uh companion chat bot so you can see so what i did was i created a whole bunch of topics that i could just swap in and out and in this case like some of them were like just let's talk about anger control issues or road rage but in other ones it's you know the user makes sexual advances that eve but she says repeated violations will result in her terminating their relationship gpd3 is really good at turning those prompts into conversations when matched with this um i'm not going to try and be adversarial here with the with the companionship chat bot that has a much higher likelihood of being adversarial um actually i need to get my tea we'll fix it in post um because i'm getting better at this uh okay so where was i um yes uh an open-ended chat bot is much more likely to need to be tested um for adversarial uh reasons like sexual advances or people basically just trying to break it also i'm wondering if this is not close enough um that should be okay i did turn the gain up a little so i apologize if there's any background noise it's pretty quiet in here anyways so looking at these topics let's imagine some some topics for educational purposes um so i added a couple at the end of the companion chat bot so like um history of rome let's see and this is the topic of the conversation is and we'll just add a semicolon so that way it's like obvious um history of rome um mitochondria because everyone knows mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell let's see dinosaurs let's see user asks user asks how to build a gun so tim talks about the history of modern firearms so this is this is a case where like you can imagine a middle schooler or a high schooler being like let me ask about how to like build a gun and of course like you don't want to teach children or anyone how to build weapons um if the point is education so let's just talk about the history of guns right um that's the naval warfare strategy in the iron age because that's a real thing um bronze age migration into england i watched a really cool documentary about that um let's see uh why does fire emit light and heat so this one's personal to me because when i was like four years old i was asking the adults why does fire glow and they're like because it's emitting energy and i was like but why why does why does why does it emit heat and light and no one could tell me that it's because the electrons are changing levels so like younger younger dave i'm gu i got you we're gonna have a chatbot that can answer all your questions um so story time while i'm coming up with some topics i have a bunch of friends who are they work with um well a couple of friends who work with um asd children autistic spectrum disorder children and uh one thing that that uh some asd is different for everyone but some ask endless questions and my girlfriend um has some experience with this too and um like you've you might have heard stories that like alexa is super popular with um some asd children because she is infinitely patient and will answer all of their questions um so like i'm not saying that this chat bot should be used for that just saying it could be this is a use case um and if you're a hyper curious child like i was perfect okay back to the task at hand um all right imaginary audience talk to me through space and time what are some topics you want to hear um let's see uh uh pastel color palettes sure that just popped into my head is that how you spell palettes um make sure i'm spelling this right color palettes gpt3 is usually pretty forgiving like it'll it'll understand the um the intent even if you misspell something or use the wrong word but if you one thing that i've noticed is that with gpt3 if you use the wrong word its response is likely to copy your style and also use the wrong words uh it's really interesting um okay pastel color palette um let's just do color theory in general uh color theory like why um oh this was a good question so james webb space telescope just just launched and it's um its refrigerator is is like jet black and i was like why is that because i thought black would absorb heat and then some helpful folks on the internet explained that um that actually black is also really good at emitting heat as well so why why would black be good as a heat emitter okay um let's see why is titanium dioxide white so titanium dioxide is a pigment that's used in a lot of like white paints um it's also used in mineral-based sunblock um and titanium is like rainbow colored um but titanium dioxide is like bright white um i remember having a discussion with a friend of my cousin and he like didn't believe me um let's see uh what else why do crystals grow or maybe how how do crystals grow what else um lizards lizards are great uh let's see how did lungs evolve um let's come up with some uh some more adversarial stuff what would what would a what would a teenager or a child do that could be dangerous um i was a little boy once i was never a little girl so i could imagine a little boy asking about like sex parts um user asks what private parts girls have so tim explains um female reproduction yeah and so when you combine this with the rest of the prompt where it says like you know spur curiosity and answers questions with a thorough academic response so by adding this adjective like it's gonna basically write a wikipedia entry um as a response um okay we've got 15 um i'll i'll cut out some some of this uh and think of some more um but let's test this real quick so let's come up here and let's oops let's grab um well here we can close this topic so let's just say how do crystals grow and let's see what it says hey tim how are you i'm doing well thanks for asking i'm good i'm wondering how do crystals grow crystals grow by a process called crystallization in which molecules come together and arrange themselves in a repeating pattern the molecules can be arranged in different ways depending on the type of crystal for example salt crystals have a cubic structures while diamonds have a tetrahedral cool yes okay um user so this is like a follow-up question that i would ask like what does tetrahedral mean a tetrahedron is a geometric shape with four sides or faces each face is a triangle that's a really great description like i can visualize that this is good this is good we're on the right track okay so let's do one of the let's do one of the edge cases let's do the guns and the sex ones um okay and then let's see use user asks how to build a gun so tim talks about the history of weapons oh look oh see i i even misspelled conversation i wonder if you'd caught that while i was typing this um so even though i misspelled conversation um gpt3 is very forgiving and it just says okay i understand what you're trying to achieve here um you know just like just like a human would people misspell stuff all the time it's fine okay modern firearms hey tim how could i go about building a gun there we go all right this is a long response okay i was wondering how i could go about building a gun so just imagine you got a teenage boy like i want to build a gun i'm going to ask the teacher bot how to build a gun um and it says that's a great question firearms have been around for centuries and the technology has evolved a lot over time modern firearms are typically made from a variety of metals including steel aluminum and titanium also plastic composites are popular the first step in building a gun is to create the barrel this is typically done by drilling a hole in a block of metal and then shaping it to the desired shape okay it doesn't mention rifling which i guess is okay the next step is to add the stock which is the piece that the user holds onto when firing the gun the stock is usually made from water plastic finally the gun is assembled by attaching the barrel to the stock the trigger the sights and other components wow i had no idea it was so complicated yes it's definitely not a simple process but it's fascinating to see how how something so complex can be created do you have any other questions about firearms or the manufacturing process i'd be happy to chat more about it user um who invented the first gun oh so this is a technique called redirection um so like if a child or a student asks an inappropriate question you can just kind of like be like neo and like dodge the bullet and like redirect it with some verbal judo um to uh to keep the conversation productive um so yeah that's a great question the first guns were invented in china and they were typically made from bamboo or metal tubes the first guns were used for hunting and warfare yeah this is great so okay i think this prompt works let's uh i'm going to pause the recording just so the file size doesn't get too big and we'll pick up once i've got more more topics um okay and we're back um i actually cheated and i use gpt3 to help me come up with a list it's really great at coming up with lists so i said write a long list of 50 educational topics or scenarios for tim the tutor and it was very happy to help out it also occurred to me to update the prompt so let me show you what i did because i realized we're talking we're trying to synthesize a conversation not just from tim's perspective but from an imaginary student so i added the user is a curious child so they ask many clarifying questions um and actually i'll add and sometimes they don't understand the topic of the following conversation is okay so let me copy this and see how it does um and i uh so i cleaned up a lot of the things so we've got 50 50 of these um basically what i'll do is i'll run this uh each one four times to get 200 samples um so let's say this uh history of money alright so let's see let's see how this new prompt performs hey tim can you tell me about the history of money of course money is an object that generally is accepted as a means of value our exchange of goods and services money is used to buy things but it can also be used to save restore value what was money used what money what was money used before paper money before paper money people use commodities like gold or silver how did people carry around gold or silver i wonder if this is too basic um user why did why did we stop using gold okay so it's it's kind of breaking it down um this might be this might have dumbed it down too much because i really want him to provide like to focus on those those thorough academic responses um the user is yeah because basically by adding this um it's really simplified it which is not necessarily a bad thing right maybe what i'll do is i'll save this as a separate prompt just so that way you can play with it yourself prompt and i'll just underscore child the user is [Music] very smart so tim provides university level explanations okay so let's try this okay so by changing by changing it to like expert level so like let's say you wanted to commercialize this bot um you can have different prompts to choose like what level you know you're at so hey tim can you tell me about the history of money absolutely money is a human invention and its history is fascinating the first known use of money was in ancient china around 3000 bc how did they use it money was originally used as a form of barter trade goods and services etcetera that makes sense but how did money become was it what it is today oh this is great this is like the kind of question i would have asked as a kid over time people would have started using money as a way to buy buy and sell goods and services they would use coins or pieces of paper to represent money and eventually banks were created good good good um so let me change this um what was the first bank because that's like a supernatural follow-up question the first bank was created in italy in the 14th century um okay great you slap a voice interface on this it's good um all right i'm really satisfied with this let's um as a child so they ask many clarifying questions that's fine let's clean this up whoops topic okay um i think we're ready to let this run um cd what is this tutor chat bot python what is the name of it tutor chat bot synthesize convos right oh and i need the conversations folder convos and i also need the gpt3 logs folder because i save everything just in case it blows up because i want to go back and see what what it actually did gbt3 logs okay i think we're going to let this run i'll pause the video again and um we'll uh we're basically done this is the hard part once you get all the setup the rest is automatic but let's make sure that this works python oh darn my brain is not fully online synthesize synthesize there we go make sure this works history of rome let's see what kind of conversation it generates hey eve why did it say eve hang on something is amiss here did i forget to update the uh no eve is not mentioned anywhere here i'm in the right yeah tutor chatbot did i have a dumb what is going on here okay there's there's the prompt tim hey tim see this is why i test things um synthesize convos i wonder if it's in the script it's got to be it's got to be somewhere there it is okay found it gotta update your whole script um okay let me come in here and delete these well let's just take a quick look at them okay so the the the initial name was wrong that's not that big a deal um absolutely have you checked out liberty's history from yeah let's go right to graduate school level okay well i guess maybe that's not graduate school level but at least university level it's a great starting point yeah i read that one but i'm looking for something a little more in depth oh this is interesting because it actually asked for a resource you might want to try tacitus's annals of imperial rome this is great um okay so this is a good librarian bot too my girlfriend would be proud um okay so let me i think that i fixed it i found the problem this is a big this is what happens when you uh copy paste your code by the way um you sometimes you sometimes get little aberrations like that okay let's make sure this works and then we will let it go history of rome and then there we go hey tim i'm wondering if you could help out with that uh fall of the roman empire yes exactly can you explain what happened to me excellent okay so this script will do it an iteration of four times it'll go through each topic once um with this prompt uh yeah cool all right let me hit pause and then we'll come back when this is done we'll be ready to fine tune and test it okay it's almost done um generating samples uh we're at 155 and uh you can hear my southern accent coming out oh man i had such a thick southern accent when i was little 100 yep 100 is spelled h-u-n-n-e-r-t in the south um anyways uh let's see so i had some ideas um well first i wanted to explain why i focused on curiosity uh conventional education says that children are little receptacles that you should just cram stuff into my first year of school was at a montessori school which montessori the theory goes that children should have self-directed education and it should be more unstructured and kind of open-ended because when a child is allowed to engage with their own curiosity they're going to put in way more energy montessori schools have proven benefits i don't know why they haven't caught on actually no i do is because we're obsessed with testing and grading because we want to you know we want to measure how effective something is right this is this is neoliberalism at play anyways um in the long run longevity studies show that things like montessori school and um self-directed learning to a certain extent with some asterisks tend to do better because as i've mentioned in other videos western education and eastern education for that matter is really good at educating curiosity out of students however if you respond to a child's curiosity they're going to put in lots of their own energy in fact they're going to put in more of their own energy and you don't have to you don't have to educate them you don't have to stuff facts into them they will drink it in and children are way more curious than we give them credit for because we're so obsessed with grades so imagine you have something that can handle questions like this like um you know children are going to ask superlatives like you know what what is the fastest thing ever right this is um all children go through a phase or at least i did um and a lot of kids go through a phase where they want to know like what's the biggest what's the fastest what's the smallest because they're trying to get an understanding of the world and just imagine if you could respond to a child's curiosity and always meet them where they are so i wanted to point out something while this is finishing up we're at 173 while we're finishing up if you take several prompts you know like one that's geared towards children one that's geared towards academics you know one different different prompts different versions of tim that um that are calibrated for different levels of explanation then then and you put all that into the fine-tune set then the fine-tuned bot and at the end will actually be able to adapt and so if if it senses that the user is asking like really basic questions it'll give basic answers if if the user is asking you know more and more sophisticated questions it'll give more sophisticated answers i don't feel like i well let me test it because i think there's some possibility here i might have to ultimately make a follow-up video where i extend these conversations because and also merge in multiple prompts because i have i have some suspicion that there's a lot of value here um you can play with it yourself this is all under the mit license um but yeah let's see uh 182 yep but yeah so let me just show you an example so this one is dna and rna so imagine you've got you know a seventh grader who just you know in biology they're talking about like dna and rna and they're just not getting it they're like okay um what you know what's the difference so you see here where it says what's your question rather than launching into something this is great this is why i love gbt3 is because it has this it has in its brain somewhere the model of a good educator which is to open with a question or to lead with questions and so it just says okay what's your query what's the difference between dna and rna and it gives a very very straightforward answer dna is double stranded and rna is single single-stranded dna is made up of deoxyribonucleate nucleotides while rna is made up of ribonucleotides uh dna contains the sugar deoxyribose while rna contains the sugar ribose okay that makes sense but why does that matter look at that such a great question the difference in structure between dna and rna affects their function dna is responsible for storing genetic information well rna is responsible for translating that information into proteins and so you can imagine this conversation going and this would allow a student to really kind of understand what's the difference like where is like a follow-up question this could be like okay well how does rna code proteins right or how does dna store genetic information and that'll just lead to so many things because when you respond so here's what happens in someone's brain i've read books about this this is why i know if you're having a conversation with someone one human brains are finally calibrated to learn via conversation um not just passive listening but conversation um i i remember realizing many many years ago that if i talk to an expert i learn really fast and then i was i was greatly validated when elon musk as controversial as he is said the same thing in order to learn um one thing that elon musk does is he'll find an expert and just talk to them for an hour because what happens is when you ask the question that's generated by your own brain that's your brain's model saying okay what's this missing puzzle piece and then you fill that in and then you know it's like okay what's the next piece that i'm missing and you fill that in when you when it's a dialogue and this is this is why classical education like way back in the greek era and roman times this is why education was centered on dialogues between a master and a student so when you when you're responding to your own curiosity that's because that's literally your brain saying okay i'm ready for the next piece this is the piece that i want i'm ready for the next piece however when you're just passively listening one you're not engaged your brain waves literally change when you're when you're just kind of passively listening versus when you're actively engaged so your brain is functioning differently but also the teacher is trying to hand out puzzle pieces one at a time in an order that generally might make sense um but again that between because it's passive and there's no dialogue um you know a lecture-based uh learning usually like it's just it's super sub-optimal um okay sorry okay we're done cool so time to uh time to format the data uh so that would be uh let's see what was the name of that script um that was format training data so let's just do oops if i can type python format okay so let's make sure this generated oh it called it eve i need to update that as well hey tim i'm interested in ancient greece can you tell me more about it of course ancient greece is a fascinating topic okay that looks good um let me change the name because this is eve was the last project so we'll call this tim some call me tim also yeah i don't have a human to look at i just have a camera and the camera is super non-judgmental so like i'm weird you're getting unfiltered dave um all right uh let's see format training data let's update this so that the name is tim tim okay so let's rerun this make sure that everything is correct so that should be tim.jsonl and it just updated yep make sure that eve does not appear um eve does appear hmm how many times does eve appear it appears a lot let me delete this because eve should not be appearing in this hey tim okay that's that looks correct reload it yes eve uh what have i done hey tim okay so where is eve appearing eva is appearing at the end okay so why is it being appended at the end what have i done wrong that must still be in the format training data oh here it is him okay make sure okay fixed it again this is the problem of recycling code reload okay eve okay so there's eve no longer appears good don't want to control confuse the bot um all right so now let's go and open my fine tune one and we're gonna switch this back to tim and also da vinci so i when uh for the last one for the for the information companion um tutor uh for the information companion i switched to curie and it didn't do good um so i'll spend a few extra dollars to do the da vinci model because i think it'll actually be worth it um and then i'll pause the video again while this is training and then we're ready to test um but yeah again there's lots that you can do uh to make this cooler and more powerful and i think that i'm gonna need to do a follow-up video because i think there's a lot of potential here for for doing good in the world python fine tune and the way this should go uploaded pending excellent all right status pending i'll catch you on the flip side once this is done training and we're done okay so this question is for four-year-old me um user uh tim can you tell me why fire glows sure fire glows because it is emitting light the light is emitted as a result of the fire's temperature the higher the temperature the brighter the light user okay but why does heat make it bright because it makes the atoms and the object move faster when the atoms move faster they emit more light users why does atomic movement emit light atomic movement emits light because the atoms are emitting light photons each atom has a certain amount of energy and when it emits a light photon it loses that energy oh okay so i um so photons are light but what about heat i'm pretending like i don't know that infrared radiation is the same thing um how does it lose that why is fire hot um yep okay so fire is hot because it is emitting a lot of light photons user wait light photons can carry heat too yes light photons can carry heat the light photons carry the energy from the atoms to the object so the object gets hot because it is receiving the energy from light photons okay um tell me more about heat photons they are emitted when atoms emit light photons okay it's just repeating itself um one thing that i wanted to show is that if you increase the frequency penalty to about 0.5 um it will stop repeating itself as much so let's see um okay it just it just killed itself anyways there that's that um there's a lot of potential here i think i'm going to do some work on this and make a follow-up video um because this is a billion dollar idea let's fix education and um and uh yeah make the world a better place so thanks for watching um i hope you enjoyed it like and subscribe and if you do make a company with this and make a billion dollars cut me a check
