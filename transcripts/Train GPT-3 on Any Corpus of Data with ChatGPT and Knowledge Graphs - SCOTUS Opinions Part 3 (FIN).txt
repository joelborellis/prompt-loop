all right gang David Shapiro here uh we are going to wrap up this uh tutorial series on uh using chat GPT to code um so first though I need to do a couple of plugs so one um I just recorded a really great podcast episode with Bax tea future um that'll be coming out on his channel uh probably later this week it was a three and a half hour long conversation um and uh we talked about the uh it was it was in one one part was a recap of uh 2022 in terms of AI and technology and then we pivoted to talk about AI startups because that's all the rage right now um yeah so look for we'll look for that over on his channel uh number two is I need to do a plug for myself um so one of my goals is to be able to do this full time and I'm not going to do it with ad Revenue so um please consider jumping over to my patreon page and supporting me on patreon one person said that they were confused by the levels they're they're no different I just gave you different options for level of support um what I what I used to do was I used to have where if you paid enough I would like give you like one-on-one time but I don't have enough time to do that so instead I just added levels and and what you do get if you support me on patreon is access to my exclusive blog where I'll give you Insider updates as to what I'm up to some of my thoughts um and also you get like Priority Access because sometimes I'll ask my patreons like hey can you connect me to something or I want to talk to you guys um so if you want to get on the inside uh definitely hop over to patreon and then lastly if you want to sync up um and collaborate with me or my team um please feel free to come and connect with me on LinkedIn I checked LinkedIn far more than Twitter or Discord nowadays so with that out of the way let's get back to what we were working on so here's where we left off uh nope you don't need to see my Spotify um so we got to the point where we have all of our all of our uh opinions broken down into Json files um so let's see the biggest one is six kilobytes that's not too big um and I got this one got cut off so it's not this one's not even not even not even good um not even usable that's fine um this one got cut off as well part of that was probably uh token limits um this one this one was finished so uh yeah so a lot of this is not going to be usable and remember this is like rapid prototyping so um I that's why I'm not that's why I'm just kind of like going as fast as I can and I'm not really like trying to make a finished product um but this is like proof of concept but we do have some that are good or almost really good at least so let's see what we can do now I went to ask GPT chat GPT uh how do we visualize it in a geffy so I've seen people talk about geffy so I went and downloaded it got it installed um it's definitely like a free open source one but unfortunately it only uses gxf gex F or graphml or CSV but we've got everything in in Json so if we want to visualize any of these we've got to do it in gex F I'm not sure what the correct pronunciation is um but graphic exchange or graph Exchange file so it's basically a type of XML so let's see let's talk to this guy and say Okay um I've got a folder called let's see what did I call this folder kg underscore Json that is full of dot Json uh LD formatted um kg files I need to convert them to gex F for gephy um but here's the problem some of the Json files are malformed not completed so we need to First check if they render properly if not we can ignore them and Skip them but the second problem is they don't all follow the same um the same uh let's see format so let me show you what I mean so for instance in this one there's no graph element but in others there are right so there's there's no graph element in this one but then we grab another one um this one has similar oh and so by the way this is why I say we need to keep fine tuning is because when you get to really specific cases like this um you want a very consistent format um and but just telling just telling it instruct so here's here's an example where there's context and like yeah they there's different like methods anyways so um foreign some have let's see for instance some have uh graph properties and others don't um we need to write a python script that will open them validate um and homogenize um we need the the ultimate goal is to um output a single gex file is this even possible do we need to break this down into multiple steps all right let's see what it says okay so it's going to walk through the reasoning that it uses okay there's a valid Pi LD uh python is valid Json LD Network X Library to create graph object from the Json L data cool okay so this just walked through the entire process um someone someone on the internet uh I think it was on LinkedIn said uh chat GPT is going to make everyone dumber and lazier you should learn to do it yourself and I definitely agree so let's talk about this because this this video is not going to take too long um but let's talk about the implications of this for a second I'm in this headspace because I just had that interview with Bax so this just taught me a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't know right um I didn't know about the pi LD thing I didn't know about Network X so I just had a problem and I said help me solve this problem now does that make me Dumber right because I didn't go read the hard way you know like I got you know I downloaded uh the geffy you know documentation but this is still like I have to skim and and and you know it's 32 Pages that's a lot of reading what is ultimately valuable time is the most valuable uh commodity in all of existence it's more precious than gold so the fact that this is able to help me do more in less time and I will learn some of the underlying stuff in the wash right so here's the thing is like we build machines to abstract away uh uh some of our labor right that's what computers do that's why they have the name computer they compute math that was how they started was um what some of the first use cases of mechanical computers was to calculate firing solutions for for big navy guns during World War II and the women who did that who did all the math they were called computers it was the computer pool but it was human computers anyways so we always build machines to offload our mental labor so this is just the next the next uh iteration of that um I'm now I'm not saying like this is not the same as a TI-83 calculator this is Miles beyond that but at the same time this will ultimately allow me to do more experiment faster and and generally accelerate things and nobody bemoans databases right like to me if someone's complaining like oh this just makes you lazy like that's about the same as saying like oh well you should just print everything out and manually collate your database like no we're not going to do that use SQL um and so to me it's like and and I'm saying this as someone who is typically like a Luddite like I am the last person to adopt new technologies usually especially in my day job in my professional life because you know what new stuff fragile and it breaks and it's expensive and it's difficult to integrate whatever etc etc but this is different Chad GPT is different because this is helping me do better here I'm going to give you a nice little Kudos feedback this is great I don't know why they have why you have to like all you need is a true false all right actually no I bet they're they're asking you why because that is a Even Better Label and they can improve it further anyways so all right get off my soapbox that's not why y'all are here let's move on excuse me okay so this is fine use it to to parse and load it into python dictionary that's fine um all right so uh let's see great idea let's start with the first script um this first one we'll use Json module to try to load the Json um we should use a try accept Clause um in case it blows up um if the Json doesn't even load we can move on um okay cool next um let's see once the Json object is loaded into memory then please please use the pi LD Library function is valid Json uh LD um to check if it is legit assuming it passes that um let's see yep uh assuming it passes that uh well actually here um please write this script um yeah and then while it's doing that I'm going to go ahead and see if I need to install anything so pip install Pi LD and then let's see what else did I need we need um I think that's as far as we need right now so let's do uh pip install Network X all right this looks good we're going to need to add the uh encoding utf-8 okay so it'll tell us if it is valid and if not excellent so let's go ahead and give this a try um so then we'll save this here as step O3 validate Json dot pi excuse me all right and then let's come over here and zoom in a little bit and we'll do uh CD to scotus and then we'll do python wow sorry my typing is horrible I think I moved my keyboard around and it's like just slightly to the left and so like my fingers are wrong muscle memory is everything man all right python uh what was that step I have two step threes that's that's incorrect that's gonna mess with my my OCD sorry buddy step o4 no don't keep it in that's the wrong pile all right come back here step 04 my counting is off my typing is off it's fine I'm doing great doing great sweetie all right no maitha has no is valid Json LD so it just made that up okay um let's see um let's see okay we got an error um are you sure this is a real function this might be harder than I thought chat gbt loading wheel I'm sorry Dave I can't let you ask that question Dave [Laughter] it's gonna get mad at me all right let's see if it works we might not even need to um validate it uh because if it if it does have a function that allows us to convert if Json LD error okay all right let's try this oh and also I just remembered that we need to replace we need to do um encoding equals utf-8 anytime we have an open um statement we need to do that because I encode everything in utf-8 all right let's try this again uh has no module validate that's fine um so in this case like it would be great if it had that function but it doesn't okay so do do do do um Let's ignore it didn't work either Let's ignore the validate step after all uh python pep 8 says it's or I don't know if it's pep 8 um uh python philosophy says it's better to ask forgiveness then permission so instead of validating let's just try to convert it directly to GIF X um is that the file type FX yeah so let's just try and convert it directly to GIF X again using a try accept Clause um uh I'd like you to update yeah dude I'd like you to update the try except Clauses to catch the errors and print them so I can see what happened so in total this script should be simpler um try to load the Json and then try to convert to GIF X in both steps I output any errors um if it is successful um actually yeah uh just print the results as we go for this script okay so let's see what it does so basically what I'm doing is I'm I'm having it write a script to do an experiment just to see if it'll get all the way through because since the cognitive labor is less on me I'm like just write this script let's see what happens right um as I was talking to some people about this kind of technology I realized we are infinitely closer to having Star Trek level computers than anyone realizes or maybe maybe we do realize that's why that's why it's uh it's exciting because with just a little bit more logic behind this I could say computer um download all the Supreme Court opinions uh about um about uh Anti-Trust laws you know and chat GPT says okay cool uh and I can if you give it an internet connection it can go find it and go find that data download it you say okay cool uh what's the what does the data look like you know computer says it's in PDF format cool scrape it and it goes from there and it says okay now what do you want me to do right and you just have a conversation with the machine this is capable of that just with a little bit more behind the scenes okay let's see excellent I love it so by it by rapidly iterating and I have done no coding except for adding the uh the encoding thing actually here um great I just need you to make one last change and that is to always include um encoding equals UTF actually I think it's lowercase utf-8 um while opening reading and writing files everything is uh in UTF eight um so let's just set that as standard for all our Scripts Hello computer would that be worth something to you okay so if so I was when I was talking with Bax one of the things he said is he suspects that chat GPT has a scratch Pad so what does that mean in technical terms it doesn't mean that it's writing on a notepad although that would be cool but what it what it what it could mean is that if if it does have a sidebar document where it can remember critical pieces of information regardless of how long the conversation gets so um if it does have that then it's like hey let me just keep track of you know the top 10 most important facts about this conversation um but yeah let's see if it works all right cool so let's come back here and do this validate Json so look at this 28 lines not bad what am I doing run the script just run the script error while converting so it looked like all of them failed but it did something um yeah this is not bad not bad at all uh it what might behoove us so if I if if I were doing this project let's say for instance I I think I got as far as I can get but let me show you what I would do um so let's let's rewind a little bit because I think I think that this is just going to blow up um yeah I don't think it didn't succeed on a single one of them um so clearly there's some fragility here um we got to Json files but they're all inconsistent and they're all different sizes and so on so what we would need to do is when we're extracting the the knowledge graph what we would need to do is probably come here and specify a format now the problem here is if we use few shot so this is why I say we need fine tuning um if we use few shot we're going to run out of tokens and even if they double the token the token count we're still gonna like the more tokens we can fit in at once the better um and but now so there's Pro there's probably some intermediary steps right because rather than just going straight from documents to knowledge graphs which it worked right worked rather well but the process is fragile we might need to have other intermediary steps such as distilling the information down so let me let me show you what I mean by that um here let me pause it for just a second as I change workspaces okay we're right back all right so I took one of these chunks it's 7 600 characters long um so rather than go straight to Knowledge Graph let's see let's do some prompt engineering and see because like we basically have to start over um all right so uh there's there's a lot of Superfluous information so um let's see how did I word this prompt this is a super valuable prompt by the way and I don't mind sharing it because I've talked to other people and they've figured it out so this is this is this is the most valuable one of the most valuable prompts I have ever figured out so write notes about the following uh document um uh let's see use bullet points um in complete sentences um I think that's all you need and then you say notes so this compression method um usually is like the best way to compress anything um yeah now one thing I don't like is that it actually used the actual bullet point character rather than a dash um use bullet points in complete sentences use um hyphen uh or the point so this is like you know blah blah so just it's a list of assertions Cedric Kushner promotions does this Don King is the president of that uh petitioner Don King allegedly that he had done this as a part through a RICO pattern petitioner Sue Don King but this is not good right this is the the so the the reason I'm okay with sharing this is because while this is a really powerful prompt it's not quite Universal and the reason that it's not Universal is because you still lose a little bit too much context and so you always have to modify this prompt um so the second circuit expressed The View that 1862 is blah blah blah um great so we're getting we're getting some of this but for instance we lost like the title right like what what is going on um so we we lost this so um we need to say like what is the document about we need to include all details um such as uh yeah so I'll just tell you include all details such as uh titles citations uh dates and so on um so that should work so from the last time um we stopped here right and then I've doubled the length of the instruction so I also want to point out this instruction would not work in text DaVinci O2 these instructions only work now with text DaVinci 03. all right so let's see what happens there we go see how the sentences are much longer so Cedric Kushner Productions uh V King is a case from October term 2000 which the Supreme Court of the United States reversed and remanded the decision of the United States courts of appeals for the second circuit bam perfect perfect so this is the kind of information it's almost even written like a lawyer would speak right this tells you real fast in very plain language what happened so this is information that that is one useful and two could be embedded in a um in a knowledge graph or could be used to extract the information now let me show you something um so actually this is actually a really good prompt I'm going to save this um whenever you come up with a really good prompt save it um prompt notes detailed um yeah so we took we took let me let's do some token counts so we took uh all right so without it it is 1966 tokens and then we combat we compress that down to 221 tokens so we got a um a compression ratio of almost 10 to 1 and we kept the most saline details and those Salient details were were kept with enough context that like it's still useful like you read this and it's like oh this is a great executive summary um so there you go uh so that this is probably the direction that I would go like rewind let's take this and instead of going to Json let's try and do this with uh with um uh gex F uh I think you guys get the point um and also we're already like at 30 minutes so we'll say that we uh we'll call this a partial success we got really far um we got uh exceptional use of of chat GPT we found a huge fragility um it was confabulating uh modules and functions that didn't exist now this isn't necessarily a bad thing so let me tell you why is because it used its imagination and I'm anthropical and anthropomorphizing it on purpose it used its imagination to imagine this is what we would need and then it just kind of went and looked for it now here's the thing it doesn't take a whole lot of cognitive architecture to find those mistakes and then say actually this is something that would be great if it existed why don't I go write it right and so then it you know it keeps track of its dependencies it could write its own user stories right say here actually let me just show you um okay um uh think about everything that didn't work write some user stories um to submit to various uh projects like Pi LD um and network x uh um uh that would have made this project easier I think this is going to work because here's the thing by breaking it down into steps there we go yes yes yes look at this look at this look at this okay so even if something doesn't work it doesn't have to necessarily fix it um live in Vivo right this is the process that we follow as humans there's no need to actually just like um excuse me to to fix it live it's I ran into a problem let's fire this off and then have another system integrate these um look at this oh man oh man as a developer I want to be able to validate Json LD data without having to manually Catch Air so that I can quickly identify and fix issues with my data yes as a developer I want to be able to easily convert Json LD data to a standardized format so that I can process and visualize the data consistently regardless of its original format yes perfect developer story or user story as a developer I want to have simple and intuitive way to create and save knowledge graphs in a variety of formats such as gex F so that I can use the tool that is most suitable for my needs excellent Universal converter as a developer I want to have access to to a wide range of layout algorithms and visualization options so they can create clear and informative visuals of my knowledge graphs that's already solved but great as a developer I want to be able to easily filter and analyze my knowledge graph so that I can gain insights into the relationships between different nodes and edges fantastic these first four or three um perfect okay I'm gonna stop here because I'm about to go down a really deep rabbit hole but I think I know what my next videos are going to be and that is using chat GPT for every aspect of the development life cycle we're going to explore agile cicd web native all that because this is incredible alright thanks for watching
