hey everyone david shapiro here with a quick video um i was having a conversation with a good old friend of mine um and uh and i mentioned the term toxic stoicism and she's like what is that and i said oh that's the thing that i have come to talk to use to talk about this this concept that's in society so i figured i wanted to teach you guys what toxic stoicism was and i'll use gpth3 to help so let's say um write a formal definition of stoicism uh stoicism a philosophy that holds that the best way to deal with difficult situations is to remain calm and rational so that's that's fine um write a brief history of stoicism the stoic philosophy was founded by zeno obsidium or in the third century bc it teaches that the way to deal with difficult situations is to remain calm and rational the stoic philosophy was very influential influential in the roman world and was later revived in the renaissance okay who were some famous stoicists i guess it would have been stoics um okay so roman emperor marcus aurelius the philosopher seneca and the writer epictetus epictetus sorry okay so that's that's kind of stoicism in the uh in the in the um sorry brain part um stoicism in a nutshell there you go okay so given all this what would um what is toxic stoicism provide an academic definition there we go okay so toxic stoicism is an unhealthy form of the philosophy that holds that emotion should be suppressed and that suffering is to be endured without complaint this can lead to this can lead people to bottle up their emotions which can lead to mental and physical health problems okay so if toxic stoicism is an unhealthy version of stoicism how what's the difference what is the difference between healthy stoicism and toxic stoicism how should a healthy stoic handle emotions okay so healthy stoicism is about finding a balance between emotions and reason it is about being able to control emotions rather than suppressing them a healthy stoic should be able to handle emotions in a constructive way um so i do want to point out that the the entire premise of stoicism is fundamentally flawed um all humans have emotions and human emotions drive everything we do uh regardless of of what a philosopher thinks however let's say how does let's see um how does stoicism influence society today let's say american society today specifically um let's see stoicism has influenced american society in a number of ways for instance the stiff upper lip mentality is a form of stoicism that is often admired in american culture this mentality encourages people to keep their emotions in check and not to show weakness so this thing about not showing weakness you probably noticed what we're building towards um what is the overlap between stoicism and toxic masculinity there is some overlap between stoicism and toxic masculinity both philosophies encourage people to suppress their emotions and to not show weakness this can lead men to bottle up their emotions which can lead to physical mental and physical health problems all right it's starting to repeat itself so we have to delete it okay um write a formal definition of toxic masculinity masculinity i know how to spell toxic masculinity is a set of harmful gender norms that dictate that boys and men should be tough aggressive and emotionless in order to be considered quote real men this narrow definition of masculinity can lead to negative outcomes such as violence homophobia and sexism okay so we've started over so now let's say um well um let's see how how did stoicism contribute to toxic masculinity the stoic philosophy which was popular among roman and greek men taught that emotions should be suppressed and that reason should be the guiding force in one's life this philosophy contributed to the idea that men should be emotionless and stoic which is a harmful stereotype okay because you know men are emotional um just as emotional of as women if not more um and like there's nothing wrong with that so there's a book called permission to feel i don't want to get too sidetracked how can we stick how can we stick with this prompt um let's see is it even true that men don't have emotions no it's not true that men do not have emotions men are just as capable of experiencing why come on wide range of emotion emotions as women are however the toxic masculinity ideal dictates that men should suppress their emotions so not that they don't have it but should suppress it and present themselves as tough and stoic it is both harmful to men and women yes patriarchy hurts everyone um let's see why did stoicism and toxic masculinity take hold let's see it says it is likely that stoicism and toxic masculinity took hold because they are seen as strength and power historically men have held more power than women and these harmful gender norms may have been used to maintain that power and balance interesting take um you know perhaps um personally having done some extra reading on the topic i will say that uh that that suppressing emotions um in america comes from victorian times so let's see how uh let's see what is the recent history of stoicism um start with victorian england write a short academic paper the stoic philosophy which was surrounded by xeno obsidium um let's see teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions the stoics believed that by understanding the reason for things one could attain a state of inner tranquility the stoic philosophy was very popular in victorian england many of the leading thinkers of the time such as thomas carlisle john stewart mill and george eliot were influenced by stoicism carlisle even wrote a book called on heroes hero worship and the heroic in history i wonder if that's a real story or a real book um in which he extolled the stoic virtues of fortitude and self-control the stoic philosophy fell out of favor in the 20th century but is making a comeback in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in stoicism among academics and the general public alike this is likely due to the fact that stoic philosophy offers a practical and down-to-earth approach with dealing with the challenges of life okay you know nothing wrong with that how did the french revolution influence stoicism in britain let's see the french revolution had a profound impact on stoicism in britain the events of the revolution such as the storming of the bastille and the execution of king louis xvi showed the british people that it was possible to overthrow an unjust government the french revolution also inspired british stoics to develop their own philosophy of government they believed that the best form of government was one that allowed the individual to pursue their own happiness without interference from the state the british stokes were also influenced by the writings of jean-jacques rousseau who argued that the state should exist to serve the people not the other way around russo's idea was ideas were very influential on the british stoics and helped to shape their thinking on government and politics so you can see that that uh you know about 200 years ago um wait 150 years ago or so when did the hang on i have this thing right here when did the french revolution happen i don't need to guess 1789 okay so just over 200 years ago um this is when this was all happening and so in the recent history because remember uh this is shortly after the founding of america and america and um and france were great allies um describe the alliance between america and france at that time um in 1778 the american colonies formed an alliance with france against the britain against britain during the revolutionary war the french provided financial and military support to the americans which was crucial in helping to win to win the war after the war uh the relationship became much closer the two countries remained allies during the french revolution and napoleonic wars america also supported france during the franco-prussian war in 1870. okay so there's a close alliance here there's also so there's this like three-way cultural affinity between america britain and france um and so stoicism which was really important at the time is still to still in effect today now when you look at you know toxic masculinity toxic stoicism this idea that emotions should be suppressed that's where you get into problems okay so we've established what stoicism is and toxic stoicism okay write a formal definition of toxic stoicism toxic stoicism is an unhealthy okay holding in emotions rather than expressing them resentment bottled up emotions and difficulty in relationships great okay so if that is our definition of toxic stoicism how can we express emotions in a healthy manner that is also consistent with stoicism there is no one answer to this question as different people have different ways of expressing emotions that work for them however some suggestions for healthy ways to express emotions include talking to a trusted friend or family member journaling or participating in therapy that's great but the underlying problem is that if you're hostile to your emotions or deny that you have emotions it's really difficult to get in touch with them um so what if someone has suppressed their emotions to the point they are no longer in touch with them um a clinical term this is called dissociation in other words someone has uh dissociated from their emotions what should they do if someone has dissociated from their emotions it is important to seek professional help this is because dissociating from emotions can be a sign of more serious mental health issues such as ptsd that is true however you do not need ptsd to dissociate from from any emotion or sensation i have a good friend who's a physical therapist who will talk about dissociation from pain so let's let's talk about that real quick so that you understand what i mean by dissociation so your brain has the ability to compartmentalize um and minimize uh sensation so what is dissociation from the perspective of sports medicine um let's see dissociation is a process where an athlete mentally disconnects from the current situation in order to cope that's close loss of consciousness what about pain can someone dissociate from a sports injury there is evidence that dissociation can help athletes cope with pain in one study runners who dissociated from the pain of running display displayed less pain and exhaustion than those who did not dissociate however it is important to note that dissociation should not be used in a way to ignore pain or injuries doing so could lead to further injury this is true this is what my physical therapist friend was talking about if you have a chronic injury that you learn to ignore and you just keep running on it or whatever you'll hurt it more hard at worse okay what is this similarity between dissociation compartmentalization and minimization i made another video about some of these topics that was really popular there is some overlap between dissociation compartmentalization and minimization all three involve disconnecting from the current situation in order to cope however dissociation is more likely to involve a complete loss of consciousness while compartmentalization and minimization are more likely to involve keeping certain thoughts or feelings at a distance okay so what if someone believes in stoicism and minimizes their emotions what would this be called and what can they whoops what can they do about it there's no one right answer this question some people might see stoicism as a form of dissociation while others might see it as a form of compartmentalization or minimization okay it's starting to repeat itself the important thing is that whatever coping strategy someone is using it is effective for them if someone is finding that their emotions are causing them to stress they might may want to explore other coping strategies okay this is getting kind of generic i think i'll stop it here the point is is that there is an overlap between minimization stoicism toxic stoicism and toxic masculinity so there you have it i just wanted to uh to produce this thanks for watching
