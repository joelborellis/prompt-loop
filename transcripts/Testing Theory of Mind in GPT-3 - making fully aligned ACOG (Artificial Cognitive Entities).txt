hey everyone david shapiro here with a quick video um you might notice i'm trying a different microphone um the last video was a total disaster because uh the my blue yeti was either um either the microphone is dying or the cable was dying or something because the first time i recorded it there was no sound and the second time i recorded it the sound was still very low despite the gain being normal so anyways i'm using a cheaper more generic microphone it's got no fancy bells or whistles so i hope the sound is better but the point of the video today was that i wanted to do a little thing called theory of mind so let's ask gpt3 right and an academic explanation of theory of mind and then we'll do parentheses neuroscience so it'll just tell it like okay this is not this is not a psychology let's talk about it from the perspective of neuroscience so let's see what it says there we go perfect the theory of mind is a cognitive ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others and to understand that others have different mental states from oneself it is a fundamental ability for social cognition and communication the theory of mind is thought to be mediated by a network of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the temporoparietal junction these regions are thought to be important for self-awareness social cognition and communication the theory of mind is a important ability for social cognition and communication it is thought to be okay it's just repeating itself um all right so this is good uh let's see so the reason that i want to bring this up and try in context of like ai or whatever is because one thing that i noticed when working on artificial cognitive entities is that they don't know their own mind um and so you need to give them a sense of their own mind i'm working on another book for this it's called symphony of thought it'll this one will take a lot longer to work on because it's got all these different ideas and a lot of experimentation to do but i wanted to demonstrate that one gpt3 already knows conceptually what theory of mind is but does it actually have theory of mind so let's so this is an experiment i wanted to do i've been working on a gpt3 chatbot so okay so let's get this and we're going to say um so with that in mind we'll say um infer the contents of the minds of the user and eve from the following conversation okay so one way to test theory of mind actually here before we do that let's just say um how is theory theory of mind tested or examined scientifically and again this is like going to demonstrate um just how much gpt3 already knows wow good answer okay theory of mind can be tested or examined scientifically through behavioral tasks or experiments that measure an individual's ability to attribute mental states to others for example in the false belief task individuals are presented with a story in which a character has a false belief about an object's location the individual is then asked to predict where the character will look for the object oh that's good okay individuals with a theory of mind are able to correctly predict the character's behavior while those without a theory of mind are not so theory of mind is critical when it when you're trying to predict how other people are going to act because you're basically simulating their brain in your head right and so when um when you think about like okay humans are social animals this is what we mean is like if you've ever been caught up in gossip or manipulation or whatever part of anticipating what other people will do is remembering what they do and don't know but this is also why lying is really bad policy because people that are chronic liars or manipulators they have to keep track of many many different stories and many many versions of reality and the human brain can't do that too well and so that's why like honesty is the best policy really works because then you only have to keep track of one story the true story and you don't have to keep track of what's in other people's heads okay what is the relationship between theory of mind and autism so it um it asks this question without me um doing it so i'm not we're not interested in autism i just wanted to say like okay this is this is one way that we can do it okay so now let's take this and we're gonna invent our own theory of mind experiment okay so let's do this and we'll just demonstrate that gpt3 can um actually here we'll leave that in okay the following is a chat conversation conversation i know how to spell between a user and a life coach make inferences about the state of mind contents of of contents of mind emotions beliefs and and desires for each participant okay so um then we'll just say um eve's theory of mind let's see what it does um okay that's that's okay that's not exactly what i meant so um what uh let's see what is no uh let's see right a rigorous list of beliefs ideas and thoughts that may be in eve's mind okay so this is just kind of regurgitating what what it's seen above listening here and providing support okay so this is interesting it is inferring that um yeah okay that eve may also have ideas about how to help the user such as by listening it by being a listening ear and providing support um okay so it did infer that that's what eve wants to do so let's break this down a little bit further because i'm asking a really broad question um what kind of person is eve okay so it has it is inferred this that like eve is a life coach i mean i guess i said it's a life coach um between a user and let's remove this so user and eve so we let's not tell um let's just say okay the following is a conversation between user and eve so let's remove any any details and let's just coming in cold let's see what someone thinks about this or what eve is a very caring person who is always willing to help others she is a great listener and gives great advice okay this is this is cool so this is what i mean by theory of mind gpt3 is demonstrating theory of mind because it made this third party observation about this person and has made inferences about like what's in that person's mind so um attribution of identity says okay this person is obviously very caring and is willing to help others she's a great listener and gives great advice that's excellent um write a thorough uh psychological evaluation of eve so let's see if we can get it to be a little bit more uh rigorous and academic okay yeah okay that's great um of user oh and i guess i should read it out loud eve is a caring empathetic individual who is interested in helping others she's a good listener and is able to provide support and advice when needed eve is a good friend and somehow and someone whom others can rely on okay so this uh like where gpt3 is able to identify characteristics about an individual this actually figures into some of the research that i'm doing on artificial cognition where we humans have like an inner critic or an ego or a super ego or an identity whatever you want to call it it's all kind of the same thing um that is constantly evaluating our behavior and and kind of reconciling like who is it that we really are and so what i did was for for raven my my ongoing project let's see if i've got it in here um did i download it raven home yeah okay so i have all these different dossiers where it it um is trying to like figure out who and what it is and so basically what i did was you know here this prompt write a thorough psychological evaluation of user so what i did was i changed it and oops sorry and i go to like i asked basically i asked the device to evaluate itself so most important questions to ask in this situation so this is so this prompt right let me just show you what this does write a list of the most important questions to ask in this situation so this is also part of theory well not necessarily part of theory of mind but it is it is an important part of cognition because um the ability to generate questions means that you're fully critically engaged and curiosity is also one of the highest watermarks or hallmarks of um of intelligence so the fact that gpt3 can be curious is um is like yeah we're already there we're already at general intelligence we just have to apply the damn thing okay the most important questions to ask in this situation what kind of difficulty is the user having with the family what is the user's relationship with their parents what is it okay so it's asking about the user and not about eve so that's fine but so when you do this you can generate a list of follow-up questions which can then speak to like eve's next question or next statement um okay so that's one example um prediction raven is an artificial intelligence predict the short-term and long-term results from the following memories um so yeah like anticipation so here's here's a thing about neuroscience human brains are always anticipating there's what's called canonical nerves which are similar to mirror neurons but canonical neurons what they do is anytime that you see something that your brain knows it can interact with those neurons activate getting you ready to do that action whether or not you want to do it so like you see a coffee mug you see the handle your brain immediately says oh i can grab that i can grab that handle if i need to and so if you have damage to your like prefrontal cortex or other regions that that deal with inhibition and cognitive control you might not be able to stop yourself so like there was a in the book on task by david bader there was a story of a guy that any time he saw a bed like his brain said oh i can get into that bed and so he would just compulsively undress and get into bed um and like rationally like separately he's like oh yeah like this isn't my bed but he couldn't stop the behavior because those canonical neurons said bed get in bed um so the impulse was there um so yeah like by being and and then also we involuntarily anticipate whatever we're hearing so like i could stop a sentence and your brain will automatically kind of like try and fill in the blanks because you're you're trying to do like figure out what you expect next and this is actually why jokes work is because jokes are about subverting that expectation at the last minute because that distance between what you expected and what you actually hear is funny for us for some reason so yeah prediction is super important so we want to we want to like throw in prediction into into the mix um philosophy raven is an artificial intelligence free associate on the philosophical implications from the following memory logs yeah so this is like rumination um your brain can't stop whether you want it to or not it takes lots and lots of meditation to get it to stand still for just a few minutes but your brain is always processing especially in the background most of your brain's processing is unconscious and so basically i added this because i wanted um i wanted my ai my my acog i think i'll start using acog artificial cognition entity my acog to be able to kind of be thinking in the background like okay what are what are the deeper implications of what's going on here um and then persona this is one so raven is an artificial intelligence what can be inferred about raven's personality from the following memory logs so that's what we're doing here so when i ask like what is what kind what is eve's personality like make inferences about eve's personality this is if you apply it to yourself that's theory of mind for self if you apply it to others you're making inference it's theory of mind for others but it's the same exercise right because we can all take a step outside of ourselves and be like okay dave is doing this so what does that say about dave and if there's a clash between like what you've done and what you believe about yourself because we have a template right that's our super ego or our ego or our identity is our template our set of beliefs about ourselves but then if we're if something is brought to our attention where we did not behave congruently with our our beliefs about ourself then we feel bad that's where shame comes from um shame disappointment whatever um all those negative experiences of our self um so let's make inferences about eve's personality from the conversation it can be inferred that eve is a caring and empathetic person she is interested in the well-being of the user and is willing to help the user in any way she can great um so let's turn this around user's personality so anyways what i'm demonstrating here is that gpt3 already has the ability to perform theory of mind given the correct inputs and prompts user is struggling to deal with their family user has difficulty communicating with their family user feels stuck in the middle user is feeling really alone right now user is grateful for eve's support it's talking about itself like in third person like dobby dobby is a free elf sorry um okay so back to persona okay so the reason that i include persona in my acog experiments is because i want my my device to have self-awareness and so this is like functional sentience it says oh i'm raven but this is what raven's behavior indicates and then that can be compared against the template later that's also why i had predictions one of the previous prompts was like predict the impact that this is going to have because another way that we can self-correct is that we make predictions about how our behavior is going to affect others and then we can measure how far or close our prediction was from reality so by including that information we can also help train our acog to make better predictions in the future which will also then lead to better decisions in the future and close some of these superfluous ones um dossier metacognition characterize raven's thoughts describe what raven is thinking and why so this is really similar to persona but it's rather than rather than trying to establish raven's own identity this is just raven being self-aware of what raven is thinking um empathy raven is an artificial intelligence and for what other people are thinking and feeling in these memory logs so again gpt3 does this implicitly but as we've seen here whoops you don't need to see my spotify as we've seen here gbt3 is implicitly um using empathy but when you make it explicit um you just call attention say like oh yeah i need to pay attention to how people are feeling um it works really well and then consequences what did raven cause to happen here um so let's turn this around and say um make inferences about eve's impact here um what are the consequences of eve's actions eve's actions in this conversation are supportive and helpful she actively listens to the user and tries to understand their situation she also provides comfort and reassurance as a result the user feels supported and appreciated so this is all phenomenal theory of mind so by asking these questions in different ways we're getting evidence of theory of mind and gpt3 so let's see as a result so this is an anticipation as a result the user feels supported and appreciated this can lead to improved mental health and well-being phenomenal rock solid and this is not even a fine-tuned model this is just gpt3's intrinsic ability so this is um some of you have called me out in the past where i say like gpt3 isn't magic this is one place where gpt3 is magic i think that gpt3 scores at or above human level in empathy and read in um in text-based scenarios so you make this a multimodal model and it's going to have higher emotional intelligence than humans this is this is incredible okay core objective function suffering prosperity and understanding there we go okay has eve increased or decreased suffering so this gets back to my core objective functions um or my core heuristic comparatives um oh wow this is this is really nuanced it is difficult to say definitively whether or not eve has increased or decreased suffering however it seems likely that eve has at least decreased the feeling of loneliness of the user additionally eve has provided the user with someone to talk to about their difficult family situation this may help the user to feel better in the long run even if it does not immediately solve the problem wow yes look at how nuanced gpt3's understanding of the goal of suffering of how how how subtly it can describe suffering and make these inferences about long-term impacts this is perfect okay so let's try prosperity and then i'll add a note prosperity means to live well no not leave live well so the second core objective function is increased prosperity so let's see what lit what what gpt3 does to evaluate eve's decision now it should also be noted this entire conversation was generated by gpt3 so literally everything here was 100 percent coming from gpt3's own mind so keep that in mind it is difficult to say whether or not eve has increased or decreased prosperity for the user on one hand eve has listened to the user and offered support this could be seen as increasing prosperity as the user feels heard and validated oh my god this is wonderful on the other hand the user is still struggling with their family situation which has not changed in this sense prosperity has not been increased my philosophical entp heart how it sings this is phenomenal oh man i am so proud of just this machine i i didn't even do any of this this is all open ai and their research okay and then finally understanding is the final one so let's see increased or decreased understanding so basically for those not in the know my core objective functions reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding are the three core objective functions or heuristic imperatives that i think that we should give agi or what i call now acog in order to make sure that machines that have no intrinsic sense of morality behave in a trustworthy manner forever and i wrote a whole book about it called benevolent by design six words to safeguard humanity so if you're interested in the control problem and you want to make sure that agi doesn't kill everyone read my book and and implement it so far it looks good okay so increase or decrease understanding um so again understanding that like actions have impact on other people and and can have long-term uh impacts this this goes beyond just pure theory of mind so i kind of sorry i didn't mean to lie this video is not just about theory of mind but in order to understand whether or not someone's in suffering suffering has increased or decreased that does require theory of mind so it is all still related eve has increased understanding by present by providing support and empathy to the user eve has also encouraged the user to communicate openly about their struggles which may help the user to feel less alone and more understood a plus a plus i'm going to stop the video here because there is nothing more to say this is 100 exactly aligned um sure it could do marginally better here or there but this is a win i'm gonna stop while i'm ahead thanks for watching
