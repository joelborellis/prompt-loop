you are live okay hello um customization [Music] let's see making sure that I did the audio correct if there's anybody on the stream how's the volume foreign does that mean that the volume is good Jordan I think it's on slow mode copy link I'll put a link in here announcements I don't think I can do announcements anymore now oh we got three folks okay um all right Jordan just gave me a uh an emoji but I don't know if that means that the sound is good so if the sound is good someone let me know because the little the little indicator is is not a it's only going up to like one dot sound is good okay cool all right well I guess let's go ahead and get started so today's podcast I think is going to focus on centralization or decentralization rather the opposite okay audio is good um yeah so hopefully we'll get more people streaming in here as we go um yeah so well first uh shortly after my last video today open AI posted their whisper um uh what was it law the uh the what should we call it the um ASR automated speech recognition so open AI let me bring it up open AI whisper introducing whisper so seven hours ago um they did uh We've trained and are open sourcing and neural net called whisper that approaches human level robustness and accuracy on English speech recognition um so yeah basically what this does is it creates you take audio and you create a spectrogram which is an image um of of the of the the registers of all the different uh frequencies and then you decode that into language um this this so ASR has been around for a while um and it's just getting increasingly more sophisticated so for instance YouTube which we're on right now has their own ASR engine in the background and that's how it does automatic captioning um yeah so it's pretty interesting I saw someone on Twitter say that they already used it so um I don't know the code is on is up on GitHub so I think I think you can you can just do it yeah um we used python 3.9.9 Pi torch ffmpeg python hugging face Transformers yeah so if you look at it on um on GitHub it looks like let's see import whisper model equals whisper load base yeah they've got it pretty pretty straightforward ready to go um I'll post a link in the chat and if I remember I sent a collab in the Discord Okay cool so Jordan I didn't see uh but Jordan had already posted a collab notebook for whisper in in our Discord um yeah so it's super straightforward um looks like it's pretty easy to use which is nice um I don't know how much memory it takes um typically eight so for a while ASR was it was uh resource intensive enough that you'd have to run it on a server or you know in the cloud or something but um certainly with uh with recent advances and also just how big gpus are um ASR is probably something that you can run locally um let me see if I can find a uh how many gigabytes you need um required vram okay here it is so the tiny version is 300 or 39 million parameters and it takes one gigabyte um relative speed 32x so it's pretty fast there are five model sizes with four English only versions offering speed and accuracy trade-offs okay so the smaller the faster obviously or maybe not obviously um but so you can do faster than real-time inference so the fact that the smallest one takes about one gigabyte that is getting to the point where you can run it locally and so this is interesting because we just um in my video earlier today I I posted about the Orem um which is the Nvidia like embedded or mobile sorry my ear just started ringing you ever have that happen where like you're in the middle of talking and like your ear just starts ringing and it's like yeah or is that just me I'm weird anyways um it's going away now so that we're in um has what is it I think it's got a a four and an eight gigabyte GPU option so that means that some of these some of these smaller versions of open AI whisper um up to so there's the tiny there's bass there and they're small so I think you can run each of those on a mobile device now so this is different because um up until now things like um Alexa and you know on your phone or whatever um any any voice recognition um almost all of it had to be sent up to the cloud and so it's kind of streaming up to the cloud and the inference is running on Hardware on somebody else's Hardware but with advancements like this that allows you to run it locally so this is going to be really important as we move towards an AI saturated world and we'll talk a little bit more about what I mean by that soon I I've learned a lot today um and there's ideas that are kicking around that I thought were like decades out but they're actually like years away not decades um but yeah so as as Transformers and and neural networks as we find new efficiencies and the hardware gets better so on the one hand like we're getting new capabilities and for a while people are like oh scale is all you need scale is all you need but we're finding that that's not true we're actually finding that more efficient algorithms are all you need um so so between more efficient algorithms and better distillation of neural networks and then better Hardware so you're going to kind of like meet in the middle right like you've got one thing coming up and the other thing going down and so they're going to meet pretty soon this happens with Technologies all the time the same thing happened with solar energy over the last few years so like the cost of solar was plummeting and then the efficiency of solar was going up and so then finally they reach parity and solar is commercially viable and so what I suspect is that we're going to start hitting that point with a lot of AI Technologies um you know because there's all there's all kinds of people on Twitter that say AI hasn't done anything and it's like the fact that you're using Twitter and that you see tweets that are relevant to you that is AI there's actually a really great I think it was on medium it was talking about how NLP is is it's so um it's invisible to us because we don't see it when it works and that's actually most AI if AI is good you don't notice it because something just pops into your news feed whether it's Twitter or Facebook or Google news feed or whatever and it's directly relevant to you that's artificial intelligence running in the background and some of it is very sophisticated some of it isn't some of it is just you know some basic pattern matching some of it is very sophisticated anyways rambling the point is that as these models get smaller and more efficient and the hardware gets better you're going to be able to run everything on your phone before too long which means you own all the data and you can decouple from you know the Amazons and the Googles and the microsofts and so we will get to a future kind of more like Star Wars where you can have your own Droid right and your Droid is just a self-contained you know robot that you own and you own its data and you own its labor um that's going to be possible sooner rather than later and I'm surprised at how much we've how much acceleration we've seen this year okay so that was a bramble let me check on the comments to see let's see we got Adrian jumped in was just testing the collab um so yeah Adrian if you uh if you post some some comments or something if you put it over in Discord because I'm monitoring Discord too um you can you can uh chat in real time and I'll share any any ideas or thoughts that you guys have um but yeah so that was the first thing um so yeah now I'm talking I was talking about uh an AI saturated future where between having more Hardware or better hardware and smaller models we'll get to a point where we have um we have even more AI just everywhere um let's see so the other big thing was I had a chance to speak with the with a couple of of the folks from Tau earlier so tell if you're not familiar is let me bring up their home page so I can just read off of it um so it's a it's a it's a it's a Dao that it's t-a-u um and it's a Dao is a distributed autonomous Network or autonomous organization um but it's not just a Dao like so Adele um is a way to basically uh run some kind of organization you can run a private company you could run a church you could run a small town whatever you can run it um with it and it's a it's a system of governance right because uh it runs on blockchain which gives you either a public or private distributed Ledger so all the officers and the governance and the rules everything can be integrated into a distributed autonomous organization and then all the rules are executed programmatically so the governance doesn't even require enforcement from outside authorities it is a self-stabilizing governance okay great so what is the differentiating factor of Tau right there's it it has it's a distributed autonomous organization they've got a cryptocurrency okay great like how does that what's different about it from everything else the differentiating factor of tau is that they are integrating distributed artificial intelligence and a number of other things now Distributing code that's nothing entirely new you can do this with ethereum as well so ethereum is by far the most the biggest most popular blockchain technology right now VMware is they have their uh their blockchain which is based on ethereum um in in private beta right now so you know this is being commercially deployed but the difference is that the Tau network is meant to be self upgrading and so it's not just a matter of executing code on nodes in the network it is a matter of through consensus because that's another thing that blockchains can do is through consensus the network itself can be modified okay great what does that mean right like this is that just sounds like okay sure like you can modify the network uh does that mean like adding nodes or changing what those nodes do so the implications of this are not immediately apparent when you look at recent stuff like pedals so petals was um just announced I don't know when it was announced but in the last few days um so petals is a way of Distributing um uh large language models so if you remember folding at home uh or seti at home this was where you would run a node on your computer and you'd process work from universities basically to do science pedals is a way to do that with large language models but you can participate in a peer-to-peer Network to run large language models this there are plenty of other people working on Distributing these kinds of workloads so you take that idea where you can run artificial intelligence workloads such as large language models code generating models that sort of thing you embed that into a blockchain into a dow and then you add the consensus mechanism and a few other things there's there's a bunch of other Technologies there's a specification language component that goes into it a few other things um but basically what that means is that any code or any capability you want Tau to do the network and everyone on that Network can work on it and come to consensus so that means if everyone on that Network says hey we want to you know uh we want the Tau Network to now include an AI agent that does you know that does voice chat you can work on that and that can come to fruition and the the compute of it is distributed on all the nodes as well as all the all the uh all the layers of the whatever neural networks need to be um included in that um other changes that you can make so say for instance that's the network upgrading itself okay great we come to consensus we give the Tau Network new capabilities that's just it's circular right it's insular not necessarily true so one thing that stands out to me about Tau is that say for instance you want to um you want to upgrade the Tau Network so that it can reach out and touch other apis let's say for instance uh you have an instance of Tau that is running a small town and then you say okay well let's let's expose an API for the traffic lights you can actually then say okay let's everyone in that town comes to consensus on how they want the traffic lights to run and then the Tau network is upgraded upgrades itself with that API call and then manages the traffic lights going even bigger you could say hey let's imagine a future you know a few decades out or maybe a few centuries who knows how long it might take you could hypothetically have the whole world basically managed through consensus where everyone participates in consensus and anything that you want the government the government uh which is this distributed autonomous organization that operates on consensus and self-improving code anything you want it to do the whole world can work on and do that so one example that I asked them about was let's say you wanted to regulate the stock market with Tau you can do that so any rules that you want it to imply or enforce could theoretically one day do that and that is the strength of having this distributed automated code generation and execution and integration and so um yeah I was completely blown away after I after I got a chance to talk to them because this is just I don't know it's like let's see a life AI research lab says hi hello welcome um but yeah so I was completely blown away so there was a book talk to who about what says angel baby I don't know oh I guess you just jumped in so for anyone who just jumped in I was talking to um some of the folks at Tau about their distributed autonomous organization here I'll drop a link in the chat so that anyone who just joined can catch up here you go um okay so where was I things are coming faster right so there's a book that I read it was recommended to me by a friend it's called liquid rain and the premise of this book I mentioned this in my video earlier so I apologize that this is a recap um but uh so the book liquid rain is uh guy goes into a coma because he's in a car accident and he wakes up like three decades later and like the singularity has happened and everything is post-scarcity and everything is cryptocurrency and everything is distributed autonomous organizations great fun right but one of the things that's explored in that book is this concept of distributed governance and also uh redistributed wealth and so I read this book I was like okay great this is all hypothetical it's this is very Pie in the Sky future but then as I have been learning about Tau their vision is to implement that to make it real where you this is this is like the operating system for the government of the future um and they're not the only ones doing this right there are plenty of other folks well plenty I know of at least two or three other groups um working on uh creating a Dao type thing for the purpose of revolutionizing you know government but also the the most interesting thing is is the idea of having a distributed AI system so there's several schools of thought where it comes to things like AGI artificial general intelligence or what I call artificial cognitive entities um and that is that you might have uh if you have an AGI that is a single entity right it's running on a server or it's in a robot like Ultron then it can go crazy it can go off the rails it can come up with its own ideas because it is a singular entity that can you know forklift itself from one platform to another but what if your AI is distributed and it's not it's not only it doesn't have a single home but it is intrinsically embedded in society now your first reaction might be to say like okay well that's even worse because if you have a distributed AGI that's embedded in everything if it goes Haywire it's going to kill everyone really quickly because it's going to be in every medical device in every car whatever however when you remember that Dows the distributed autonomous organizations they operate based on consensus so that means if we ultimately endow or uh yeah um endow a a distributed network with any kind of autonomy or general intelligence it will be with the consensus of everyone which means that the design of it will be worked on over time and the uh the capabilities that we give it will be worked on with like a global consensus basically or distributed consensus with however many people are participating and so that means everything that that does will operate on consensus and so that means that like that's not a guarantee but one way that that could be implemented is that the AGI will have the primary you know objective function of maximized consensus whatever consensus is maximize behavior that optimizes for human consensus which is a very interesting possible objective function now here's another thought experiment with consensus and oh I need to specify I'm not talking specifically about Tau anymore um because this is all just my own speculation so I am not speaking on behalf of Tau uh I just want to clarify like I'm not their spokesperson or anything I just had an interesting conversation with them and my mind is churning about possibilities so I just wanted to to clarify and pull back on that just a second and okay someone jumped into a Discord chat but that's fine um Okay so possibilities right so here's an interesting thing if because a dowel works on consensus if the whole world or whoever's participating comes to the consensus that that Dow needs to shut self down that code can be created and then executed right like if everyone says like this Dao is going haywire let's shut it down like that could happen um alternatively if people say hey like this Dow is going crazy we need to completely restructure that can happen too okay so that's my opening Spiel and it's been 20 minutes already so let me um we've got a few folks in chat so let me ask uh what questions do y'all have in terms of distributed artificial intelligence and distributed autonomous organizations um I will also repeat this in chat just for anyone who jumps in what questions do y'all have about distributed Ai and vows and I understand that this topic might be a little too Arcane we can also talk about consensus because consensus uh is something that folks often don't fully understand um I could here I'll actually do a quick little poll all right uh let's see direction of conversation could you repost a Discord URL please yes I will do that in just a second um actually probably someone else in chat could while I'm working on the poll so uh Jordan or anyone else from Discord if you could share the link I don't know if that'll work though if it doesn't I can share it um direction of conversation for tonight um let's see gal uh distributed AI had option um and then or consensus and then last option uh something else tell me in comments okay there we go okay all right let me get you a link to the Discord so for anyone who's not in Discord join here all right we've got one vote for distributed AI so we can keep talking about that um talk about that until oh no we got something else so need to argument okay looks like distributed AI is taking the lead do he centralized Ai and distributed AI um [Music] sorry I'm just Gathering a little bit of information I didn't just like blip out of existence okay oh cool somewhere says some uh a life AI research lab says they watched all my fine tuning videos today and they liked it and it helped improve their results um okay Jordan says he's driving but wants to know about distributed fine-tuning so petals I believe allows for distributed fine-tuning um and then angel baby wants to know about self-aware um I think they meant AI not aw so doing a mental mental uh spell check okay but distributed AI is Far and Away the most popular idea um Okay so there are there are the primary benefit of distributed AI or decentralized AI is also the primary risk so the benefit is that it is resilient and difficult to shut down that is both a benefit and a risk so it's a double-edged sword because if you can't shut it down like you can't stop the signal man um that could be a problem oh we got a comment who was that where are you oh that was another another platform sorry let me mute that tab mute here we go okay um yes so distributed AI so in principle like I said it you have there's a couple ways you can do it you can have a centralized um thing where you've got like you know a university or a company that's just kind of issuing orders to nodes like a botnet right so you can have the botnet model which is kind of the older fashion seti at home or folding at home model of distributed AI or distributed machine learning nothing wrong with that but you have a central controller that completely dictates everything now fast forward a few years and we've got distributed autonomous organizations which are based on blockchain technology which that blockchain can either can you you've got nodes on chain right on the network um and you can you can execute code in a distributed fashion so now you have the possibility of executing code in a reliable manner across an entire network and that means that if you if you also have a recursive aspect to that where you can execute code based on consensus based on what the network wants you to execute then you have the possibility for any kind of distributed workload including distributed AI so what goes AI there's two primary components that go into AI there's data which is the the information that you're putting in and then there's the model which is you know the the neural network or the support machine or the clustering algorithm but those are the two primary components so you've got data and model so when you have distributed AI you're Distributing both you can be Distributing either or both of those aspects so for instance one thing that you can do is you can have data gathered in a distributed fashion so you have many notes all contributing to data in this like grid fashion so imagine that you have a city that's run by Owl and then you have sensors all over that City like pedestrian sensors sewage sensors trash sensors all kinds of stuff and so then the data is being shared in a public manner or maybe it's a private letter either way public or private letter Ledger the point is is that the data is is all being gathered in a single source of Truth and then you can have models also embedded in that Network that are processing and telling garbage trucks where to go for instance this is a very basic use case but it is a a a feasible first use case because it's also pretty safe um you're not going to worry too much about like accidentally causing nuclear war if you have distributed AI telling dump truck where to go um and you're also not going to worry too much about privacy um because you know a trash sensor like there's plenty of trash bins that have sensors already my cousin worked on like radio trash like dumpster sensors like a decade ago or more that used I think 3G at the time um not even 4G they use 3G radios and so then imagine that you've got you know Edge Computing devices that have a little bit rather than talk let's see isn't this what the 5G network is aimed at yeah partly um partly uh actually 6G is one of the bigger ones so surprisingly enough um VMware was actually a big contributor of the 6G standard um I think they worked on it last year or maybe the year before and I read it because I was like even even VMware was like why are we participating in 6G isn't this um in this radio and what was it uh open network um I'm not remembering like can I don't remember anyways um yeah so this is let's see hence the fuss about Huawei yeah uh well hallway is a whole different story so I'm not going to open that can of worms yet um but yeah so getting back on track um you have Edge devices uh you know distributed networking and so rather than having them controlled by you know one platform or another like you know Google Amazon Microsoft Azure whatever they all participate in in in a dow which is you know for in this case this this hypothetical use case might be a city and so then you have a sensor on it on it on a trash bin or something and it says hey come pick me up um that's a very basic use case now looking at a more advanced use case especially since we've got um large language models today large language models allow us to start to do work with natural language instructions and natural language contracts so one of the problems with AI up to this point is that you need very formal symbolic language if this then that you know uh very very strict representations as to what you will do sometimes going as far as just representing it as code right like I'm going to give you this piece of code you execute it because the piece of code is deterministic what I think is going to happen is as we as large language models become more familiar more robust uh more reliable we're going to start to see uh where natural language conversations happen and that is how you uh come to consensus so this is some this is going back to Tao one of the things that I talk to them about and this is in their white paper and on on their blogs too they have a Blog on Liam um I'll post a link to that real quick actually uh let's see pal medium there we go it's powchain.medium.com in case you can't see the uh the chat later on um anyways so what they do or what they're planning on doing I'm not sure quite how developed the technology is but they're getting they're working on getting funding um so they've they've got something um so what they're going to do is by having those conversations uh because this is how you arrive at consensus right is you get everyone they're having a conversation so this is the coolest part this is what I'm building up to you have a conversation about an issue that you care about right it could if you have if you have children you might be talking about you know participating in in a part of of Tau that deals with like the Parent-Teacher Association and the school board right and there might be other things that you don't care about right like you might not care about trash pickup or whatever um but as you have conversations on the Tau Network it will build a representation of you so that it can Advocate on your behalf even when you're not participating so this was something that was explored in that book I mentioned earlier liquid rain and I was just like okay cool like I agree that this is a great idea but it's not even possible right um but I disagree with myself now um this is what happens change your mind over time so what they call it is a world view capital W world view where over time they build up the Tau Network builds up a world view of you of every participant in it so that it can be a digital or virtual Avatar of you to represent your interests even when you're not there and so then what it can do is it can go have essentially virtual debates with every other entity every other world view in order to find the right solution so what is the big difference between consensus and democracy because it's not just voting right if it was just voting we've got plenty of systems that can do that the thing about consensus is that consensus requires everyone to work together to find new Solutions um which is like you have to reach reach out and be creative um because it's not just an up down vote like approve this measure or you know yes or no against this bill or vote for this person or that person that's democracy it's not voting consensus is a creative generative process where everyone comes together and part of consensus is you get every everything that everyone cares about and knows about you get all that on the table and so that's got to be stored in the network somewhere and then once you get all those concerns they start coming up with possible solutions and so the key thing about consensus is that you generate Solutions and possibilities and iterate over them until you come up with something that everyone can live with until you come up with something that is better than what you originally thought you'd end up with and that is the power of consensus and that is the power of embedding a consensus mechanism a natural language consensus mechanism in something like Tau so then you have a natural language or otherwise a mathematical representation of you your worldview your digital Avatar and it's going out there and advocating on your behalf and as these AI systems get more sophisticated over time they will then be able to be more creative and more generative out on the network without you participating coming with new Solutions and so another thing that's really interesting about this is because remember I said there's two components there's data and there's model right so there's going to be a model of you this is what I call an agent model so how they call it world view I call it an agent model so an agent model is just a representation of you your beliefs or not you but just a character because an agent model can be used for a robot it can be used for a dog but like I have an agent model of myself so like my agent model says I am human I am a white guy I wear glasses I know that I know a lot about Ai and writing that's my agent model but if you take a copy of that agent model from my head and put it onto a network there's other kinds of data right so those agent models are those World Views can be on the network but you can also continuously inject new scientific information or new ideas into that Network and all that data can then be used with other models to come up with new Solutions everyone approves of or disapproves of until until that's a until the negotiation comes up with a result now just because there's a debate doesn't mean that there has to be an answer or a decision made because with consensus you can decide we don't have enough information right now um that is a perfectly legitimate decision with consensus where you you could you say okay we decide not to do anything definitive right now because we don't know enough and so instead we're going to launch a you know investigation a six month long investigation to gather more information or do some experiments or something right and that's what you can do with consensus one other thing that I um uh talked about when I spoke with uh Tau the some of the folks from Tao earlier was that um consensus is something that it the most familiar model that people have with consensus is scientific instances and so the the way that things work with the scientific Community is that one you have to be a valid player right you have to have the university backing you have to be accredited or otherwise graduated right you have to have a PhD or MD or whatever so there's certain levels of credentials um that you have to have or you can even participate in scientific consensus now um in the book uh consensus through conversation um which is one of the the best resources to understand consensus there's nothing wrong with that um it is a little bit gatekeeping it is a little bit elitism but the reason for that is because you have to decide who belongs in the discussion for consensus well for science that works you want scientists to be participating in scientific consensus you want um you want you know uh scientists with their reputations intact with valid you know credentials so that you know that they can participate but what happens when you're trying to do consensus for everyone in a city or everyone in a nation or everyone on the whole planet right because we have to you know we're thinking long term here where it's like hey what how do we do consensus for eight billion people or 10 billion people or however many billions of people we're going to have in the future and so then you have to be allowed to participate in consensus whether or not you're qualified and so that means your needs right you like your basic human needs your wants your desires your opinions need to carry weight regardless of whether you understand consensus and so this is where a natural language interface with it makes sense and this is so I'm tying it all back to distributed AI because if all you can do is just you know have a chat interface whether it's text or voice where you can interact with the system and it'll build up your worldview and then it can go and Advocate on your behalf with what you need and want in life then that is a fundamentally different uh kind of government that might be possible time will tell so let's see um we've had a couple other people vote for other some some other topic but no one has said in chat what they want the other topic to be so if there's something else you'll have me to talk about then like let me know in the chat I think there's at least two people um who want alternative topics so but that that's my Spiel as I understand the direction of distributed AI as it pertains to distributed autonomous organizations right now so I'll take a drink of water and see if anyone has any requests for alternative topics but also we're already 40 minutes in so this time has gone by fast so I've only got about 20 minutes left because I usually try and keep these down to an hour um before I run out of steam going once going twice Bueller I'm probably dating myself when I use that reference Bueller anybody all right the Bueller School all right AI life AI research lab says AGI okay cool let's talk about AGI for a minute or maybe last 20 minutes who knows let's see any plan to start a bloom 176 form for fine tuning um yes Jordan I would love to do that and I think um I think I think Chris on the server wants to do that too um so but let's focus CGI for a little bit um actually No Angel Baby Says like yeah he wants to do that too okay um I guess the short answer for creating a balloon form from petals um I mean why not yeah let's see about when you predict when we start seeing the suing against miles like stable diffusion for reasons like copyright infringement ah now that's an interesting thing okay so topics we'll talk about um setting up a swarm um using something like pedals we'll talk about AGI and then we'll talk about the legality of stable diffusion and and AI art AI Art Is Hot Topic Okay so um the shortest topic that was brought up is um I am not personally planning on setting up a an open source swarm just yet however um I excuse me I definitely support anyone else who wants to um so yeah that's that's about all I got to say on that um I think that it's coming fast so as a technologist this is one thing is while I am participating in Cutting Edge research as a technologist as an I.T professional I am I like cringe away from first generation first iteration things because I know that they're fragile and that they break and so this is like a weird dichotomy this is a this is a pro this is a Dave problem in my own head on the one hand I always want to be playing with the most Cutting Edge things but on the other hand from my day job I know that playing with Cutting Edge things invites disaster right like for my day job I'm like let's stick with something that's tried and true and stable because you know what I've had way way too many late nights and you know like there was one time that uh this was this was uh about eight years ago where like we released a patch right we updated a bunch of servers and then they started um they started crashing and then it took like eight hours of Investigation to figure out that it was a firmware incompatibility and then the next four hours patching everything again and this was all on a Sunday um so it's like I am so phobic about those things from those experiences but then on the other hand I'm like yeah let's try everything new um so this is just like my own like I'm not going to say schizophrenia I'm not schizophrenic and I don't want to uh invalidate or or uh make fun of people who do struggle with schizophrenia I've known people that struggled with schizophrenia it is soul-crushing for their friends and family but for me it's like this dichotomy I guess this is the the kindest way of saying there's this dichotomy of Cutting Edge versus stable um okay so the next topic was AGI or maybe we'll do uh we'll do um let's see you should clip the last two minutes and upload a video to why to avoid the bleeding edge yeah I could do that um uh I've actually been thinking about starting to get a professional Editor to come pop up these videos because one thing that's interesting is that some people reliably watch all of my videos but most people only watch a few minutes right and so I'm wondering like maybe I do a highlights reel um Lex Friedman does that where he'll release like the whole video which sometimes they're like four hours long but then he'll also do a highlights reel it's only like 15 minutes so maybe I'll start doing that um if there's any volunteers who want to uh want to help me out with that um otherwise I'll just have to learn to do it myself oh well okay so um stable fusion and and copyright infringement um oh boy that's I'm not a lawyer so I'm hesitant to cut to comment on this um because with things like um the dmca and digital the Millennium Copyright Act and and a whole bunch of other um established litigation and jurisprudence anything you publish on the Internet is technically automatically copyrighted at least at least um at least written works are like if it's a book or short story or whatever I don't know about images though um so if someone knows specifically uh about that automatic copyright uh please let me know um so but so there's already murkiness right because if I write a blog post and it's in my name technically that automatically copyrighted um so but what does copyright protect against copyright protects against theft and then reproducing it you know and and passing it off as your own let's see someone says they could be liable yeah I believe law accounts that stuff is public yeah so like the uh i p law like copyright law is so complex um that's why I was just like I'm just I'm just guessing here right this is this is not even educated yes this is just based on my understanding um let's see avatars need to be able to go into multiple websites uh but when the avatars become more AI based well they need to be aware of covert spyware interesting interesting idea um I'll come back to that because that is a very good question but it also requires a little bit of unpacking um okay so the short version is um copyright law is super murky because then the idea is like okay well derivative works are allowed right if if you make if you put in a lot of effort and you um and you like make a parody of something that's allowed right there are Star Wars parodies or Star Trek parodies um musical parodies that is protected right that's a derivative work and that's that's allowed in most cases or many cases um so then the question becomes okay well is AI a derivative work but it's not created by a human or the human just had to put in a prompt is that actually value add or is this just a machine churning out derivative Works um if you can't put your finger on this person copied this thing exactly it's going to be really difficult right let's see um web scraping recently pronounced legal okay I'll have to take your word for it um I I have heard that's so many times at least for text-based stuff that scraped data can be used for AI because if you put it if you put it up publicly and it they don't just steal it then okay like yeah um all right so going back up so that was stable diffusion we had one request for AGI but now the conversation like seems like it has moved for um for uh let's see there's avatars so the idea so little ape Escape clut skate Club um sorry um says avatars need to be able to go into multiple websites or metaverses but when these avatars become more AI based will we need to be aware of code or spyware so I'm gonna have to make a few assumptions about what you're referring to so this um I think what you're probably talking about is going back to that idea of having an agent model of yourself or a world view um in the in this potential future with the distributed autonomous organization there's a virtual copy of you or a representation of your needs going around and interacting with other sources of information if that's I think that's what we what we're referring to 19th century our AI our AI artworks of the the are they the new camera yeah I mean you know there's it's possible that um that a AI art is you know because I mean when the when photography came out people said that's not art but you know we've defined that into uh into art okay so little ape skate Club confirmed that that's what I was talking about like having our digital avatars going elsewhere and and needing to be aware of spyware yes the short answer is yes absolutely because privacy your digital Avatar as a representation of you just the just the information it has about your beliefs and why you want the things you want that is a huge Target for privacy breeds so let's say for instance you've got someone what's a controversial topic that I can talk about um well I'm not going to miss anything just imagine a controversial thing that you believe in that you want um but it might be illegal right now right so let's say you live in a country where um guns are presently illegal or alcohol is presently illegal and you tell the atar like you tell you you interact with this with this with the Tau Network or something like it you say you know I think this should be legal it's something that I do all the time and and I'm not a bad person clearly our moral laws are just wrong um and so now you have you have basically admitted to a crime to to the network uh could that be used against you because what if what if consensus on the network says hey we need to go on Witch Hunt and find every you know Heathen in this network who is who is working our moral laws and wants you know and is using alcohol or wants you know buy guns or whatever and so we can go hunt them down right that is the tyranny of the majority which is absolutely a possibility with something like Dao especially if it's a global Dow that you can't choose whether or not you participate in it um now that being said as a thought experiment if you do have a global Dow and we all work we all come to consensus that say yes some people should be able to opt out that's an that's entirely possible but once your data is in a blockchain it's possible to remove right and so one thing that I think and this is I guess would be open to consensus one thing that I think is that all data should be anonymized so where you say like okay like someone with a uuid right or you know maybe every conversation is just given its own unique identifier but no other identifying information so it's like okay you know someone at you know timestamp X in Block y you know with uidz said this and other than that like that representation is completely autonomous so there is a technology and this is actually I know about this from from the Discord server um one of the technologies that could enable this for security is what's called fully homomorphic encryption um and I had to look it up because I had an idea what it was so fully homomorphic encryption means that you can have encrypted data and they can work on that data and get the same result um whether or not that data is encrypted or decrypted and so what that allow is that your your data stays encrypted in such a way that nobody else ever sees it but the LM or the the AI can work with it and generate a result whether or not you see it so then um AI research lab says that's how I handle my consumer apps I think that you're probably responding to keeping data encrypted at all times or maybe it's encrypted locally on your on your users devices something like that um so that's another possibility so at the beginning of this of this podcast episode at this live stream I was talking about how models are getting smaller and faster so one possibility is that your data never leaves your device right um or you know never leaves your uh oh Anonymous session IDs yes okay yeah um I'm a big fan of an anonymous session IDs as long as long as the session is validated it was a real human saying the thing because you might also one one problem one downside with Anonymous session IDs is that you could have a bot you know uh bot attack um that says like hey um you know we're gonna spin up a million and a half Bots that are all going to advocate for you know like abortion bans or something or maybe you know yeah denial of service or distributed denial of service attack basically against the towel so you have to you have to balance like okay can you can if if you anonymize everyone's opinions can you still verify that a real human saying it so that's a that's a big problem um uh in order to in order to do this which this is one reason why you know like uh Democratic voting I still think is like because you go there's a there's a physical location you physically you know show up um you know there's the you there's a human that interacts with you and it says okay I'm interacting with a human and a human hands you your voter you know your voter sheet and then you feed it into a machine and there's a physical copy right um you can't do that with robots yet you can't do that with a with a botnet yet however if we move to a uh to a fully digital Dow um you could have a botnet kind of adversarially attack and try and get policy changes um so that's a huge huge risk um but yeah okay so I went through many tangents there um I'm gonna try and remind myself where I was going with all that um but those were some good questions this always happens where like usually by the end there's some really good conversations happening um let's see so Anonymous session IDs distributed or a denial of service attacks yeah so well we've only got about five minutes left any fine questions before we wrap it up for the night God this this hour has flown by it feels like 20 minutes for me um but yeah we'll uh I'll wait for just a second then we'll wrap up for the evening two two two two but yeah okay I guess I'll I'll respond to um little ape skate club's last comment about like our current AI works the new camera right so every time throughout all of history every time art Has Changed by a technology there have been people who fought it right um even novels right we take we take for granted that the novel today is a um is is a work of art but when novels first came out there was a whole bunch of people who were so mad because they thought that that books should just be academic and should just be enriching you know like they should just be used for religion and Science and government and that's it and that it was like sacrilegious to have you know tripe you know like erotic fiction or any fiction whatsoever in the written word and you know like okay today we're like no like the novel is an art form and I'm a novelist right that's what I do that's one of my my side my side projects is is you know uh as I write and it is absolutely a form of Art so what about you know fast forward to cameras right where instead of having to master watercolor and paints and brushes and Engravings you just have a device and you go click like that's loafer right but you look at how people like yes there are disposable cameras you can go to the store and get you know a 10 disposable camera take pictures everyone carries around an HD camera in their pockets all day um but you know nobody's complaining about that right like just because you have a camera in your pocket doesn't mean you're a good photographer right you take one or two like photography classes you will improve your your quality of photographer um several times like I took a photography class back in high school and it still shows right so just because the tools change doesn't mean that it's not a new form of art um but it also just because it's easy doesn't mean that it's easy to be good at so I had this conversation with my fiance earlier is um when you become an AI billionaire what can I do to be on your um let's see and then also the AI research lab says homomorphic encryption for ML training is something that someone I know does yeah so it's it's growing um very slowly there's only like eight people in the world who work on it but hey your friend is one of them um I don't know that I'll ever be a billionaire because I open source all of my work um yeah so oh speaking of um Ai and art I have decided to open source Auto Muse and so here's the story so I was working on auto Muse which if you're not familiar with that that is my attempt to write a full-length novel with AI and um I had some really good um has your opinion about the extent to which art is really just Advanced pattern recognition and not to shred it at all uh change after the text to image models have come out um the short version is no uh so this was this was a question um was about like what is art um no so the point of art is that it is a fourth communication it is a form of human communication uh that is that is Honorable uh and communicates ideas emotions so on and so forth um okay so anyways Auto Muse uh just Google it it's one word a-u-t-o-m-u-s-e um I have decided to open source automus and there's two reasons so one when I talked to the folks at Tau earlier I realized that everything that I want to achieve with artificial cognitive entities and um and and cognitive architectures they're working on right um and they're working on stuff that's more sophisticated than anything I could ever do myself um and so it's like okay cool like I'm just along for the ride um so you know uh what I can do is I can popularize these things I can be a voice for it because I can understand it and communicate it um and I can work on building consensus to buy into a consensus model the second thing that happened um so I guess to put it into perspective I realized that I have way more important work to do than trying like you know focus on generating AI novels um the the second reason was I got um oh Auto Glass looking bot nice to definitely see you live hello um are are you on Discord uh you don't have to answer but just hi um so the second reason is I got feedback from my editor today um I contacted this editor after hearing them on a podcast a couple of years ago and I just I made a mental note when I'm ready when I'm closer to being publishing I'm gonna work that editor because they think like I think and I want to work with them so a couple years later here I am I'm ready to go I sent them my novel uh about a month ago and they finally came back with some questions it was just like oh man like I know from watching and listening to other authors like how humbling it is to like send your workout to an editor or um or a uh a a a reviewer or an agent um and so I was ready for that like they it was so nice they sent like um they sent a couple emails like like we know that you're working very important to you and this is a very vulnerable time so just be ready I'm like whatever I'm ready um and so then I got the feedback or the initial like questions and I'm just like where are these coming from like holy mackerel this person is like I mean again I shouldn't be surprised right like they've they edit books all day every day professionally they specialize in it of course they know more about writing than I do because or they know about writing in a different way right because basically the the relationship between an author and an editor is a generative adversarial Network because I've got a book writing Network in my head and they have a book like shredding Network and so we have like this system of like Gans like and it's like okay so we have two of the like the most powerful computers on the planet right human brains working at like an exaflop I have an exaflop scale computer in my head running on 20 watts of juice and then there's another one that is trained for years to like attack my work and I was like yeah there's not a snowball's chance in hell that like I can make like polished novels with gpt3 that's just not happening um I got really close to generating a a first draft a rough draft but as someone else I know it's on YouTube or maybe it was in Discord someone pointed out that there is a there's a huge Gulf between a first draft of a novel and something that will actually sell and and take Market space and after getting feedback from an editor from a professional editor I see that even as someone who is a die-hard committed artist like I want to I'm going to spend the rest of my life getting better at writing novels and writing fiction giving people feelings and giving and giving people stories even with as much work as I put into it just one other person who is trained to to critic to critique that work like no it's not going to be possible to do this with gpt3 it might even not be possible to do to to Really fully generate a full novel and polish it maybe not even with gpt4 right even if even if we have an AI model that is 10 times smarter than gpt3 it might not be possible so I was just like all right there's if I open source automated and I'm not going to take anything um that sounds like you're ready to move on to the next project yeah so well I'm not going to move on from Auto Muse I'm going to release it all and get it as far as I can so there's a limited scope of what we can do right um so what I'm going to focus on is getting really good synopsis because that's a paragraph that can fit in gpd3 and then also generating plot outlines because that is also something that gpd3 can can do really well so I'll release all that work and probably then yes I'll move on but let's you know I've got a few other ideas kicking around anyways we're at just over an hour and I'm running out of steam so um yeah so someone says it's possible to do it in sections I'll say yes but gpt3 can produce excellent Pros as long as it's about a thousand words the the the the the biggest barrier is like okay can you keep track of an entire story because remember an entire is 50 000 words right you're not going to fit all that into one prompt even if you summarize it right because everything that all the lore you need to keep track of is not going to work right now believe me I tried and I'm like one of the top folks in the world working with gpd3 it there you cannot summarize it concisely enough you lose too much detail um I'll probably publish what I've got soon maybe tomorrow anyways uh one last comment do you think we're gonna have ai based art classifiers that rank pieces of art yes that's one of the things I'm working on I'm building my own generative adversarial network with with one GT3 model versus another to make better synopsis and better plots stay tuned see that tomorrow probably all right have a good night everybody [Music]
