hey everyone david shapiro here for another episode of the raven agi channel in today's episode i'm going to show you how to get started with raven agi it's pretty simple there's only one major prerequisite that you need and that is that you'll need access to openai so openai created gpt3 which is at present the only cognitive engine powerful enough to run raven i'm sure there's going to be competitors in the future and also unfortunately right now open ai is still in beta which means that you need to sign up to get access uh but i personally anticipate that it will go live by the end of 2021 certainly within uh 2022 and then there will also be competitors i know google and amazon and a few others are working on similar transformers uh generative pre-trained transformers like gpt3 and of course openai will probably be working on on other services so unfortunately like i said right now this is the only one capable of running raven so this is where we've got to go so you go to open a uh sorry beta.openai.com you click join the wait list and then you fill this out you fill out the form um most of it is pretty standard um and the one one tip that i'll give is that you should probably give as much detail as possible don't just you know not just one or two sentences like you've got you've got a big text field so you can you give give a lot of detail that's what i did um i gave a link to my work um and and that's how i got approved so uh once you once you submit that it did take a few months so just to set expectations i think it took about six months before i got approval to be fair though i did i did submit approval almost immediately after it became available so it took a while but i did get approved and i got my api key once you get approved you'll get a welcome letter they'll invite you to the slack channel and then you can go into your settings and get your api key so once you get your open ai api key then what you want to do is you come over to the public repo for raven the mvp which is minimum viable product so remember this is just this is the base the bare bones version of raven there's going to be a lot of improvements to raven over the coming years so you go to github.com daveshap ravenmvp click on the code button the big green button they make it easy to find click on the clipboard or you can just click on the uh the text box and copy then open up a command prompt and you do get clone um oh i'm just also assuming that you have git installed i'll show you where to get that in just a second so you do get clone and download it um to get m.com and then you can get it there um all right so once you get this clone down cd into raven mvp der so you can see it gives gives us a few files we'll do explorer c raven mvp okay so here's what it'll look like you can run this on windows or linux or mac or whatever as long as you've got python there is one requirement that you have to install and that's here it's just open ai so once you if you've got python installed it's really easy just do pip install open ai and all this does is act as a as a easy set of bindings to talk to the api you can also do it with curl or uh or your own um rest requests um but they're they're a little their little module is pretty simple um so i've already got it installed but it's just these three things pip install openai and i also have all this on the readme page here i think that i don't have the uh the install requirements so i'll add that um but yeah so once you get to that point you're pretty much all set you've got the code downloaded you've got your access to the key and then you've got the uh you've got this so the last thing that you need to do is you have to create this text file um it'll be called openai api key dot text this is mine i'm not going to show you what my api key is but i'll just copy it in and this is what the services will use in order to authenticate to open ai and this will give you access to gpt3 so then what you do once you've got all this set up you've got your api key you've got the code you've got open ai installed you just do python service nexus and there you see it's it's running it says service flask app nexus lazy loading yada yada away it goes here's the raven mvp and it's running and there you have it you are ready to go you could go ahead and put in any context you want you could say mary had a little lamb and then see what raven wants to do i'm not gonna do that because i'm gonna i'm not gonna waste my tokens but uh there you have it you know i started from nothing uh this morning i showed you the the entire process start to finish to get started with raven um so good luck and uh i hope that uh i hope that everyone has some fun and and starts participating in the research thanks for watching
