morning everybody David Shapiro here with your daily videos oh let me cancel out a flux so that the screen doesn't look too orange okay um so Auto Muse uh if you saw the live stream last night which you might not depending on when you're watching this video um I explained why I'm open sourcing Auto Muse and I'm Gonna Keep it all open source from here on um the short version is two things happened one is I had a conversation with some of the folks at Tau and I realized like no I got to focus on the things that are really important which is making sure that AGI happens correctly and of course I'm not going to do that by myself there are plenty of people working on it around the world but I can focus on doing my part rather than focusing on writing novels um well I mean I'll still write my own novel but I don't need to keep this code secret um more important things to focus on code wise the second thing that happened was I got feedback from my editor for my novel and I realized that um that no matter how good someone is as a writer and by no means am I an expert I've been studying the craft for almost four years um and it takes you know a lifetime to master an art um but even so despite all the effort the crazy amount of effort I've read so many books and gone to so many workshops um I send my my novel to an editor sorry I send my novel to an editor and there's just so much more expertise that goes into editing a novel then goes into writing a novel it's a different kind of expertise and so what I realized is that the relationship between an author and an editor is actually a lot like a generative adversarial Network where on the one hand I am the generator I'm generating a work and then the editor is the discriminator um and so uh I realized that that while while we can definitely do some some generative adversarial networks with gpt3 on small scale things um it is not going to be possible with the current token limits um like we can do we can do again for short stories and flash fiction um and even trying to do it in sections is not going to be possible so even if I had a few years to work on like fine tuning and summarization and stuff um it's just it's not going to happen so I'm not worried about disrupting an industry the technology isn't there yet but there are a few things that we can do so as part of the auto Muse project I'll start with the synopsis generator and the synopsis generator does exactly what it says on the tin it generates synopsis and so I've generated um 200 some odd synopses and let me uh well here they don't look good on on GitHub so let me show you what they look like here so I've generated a whole bunch I've deleted the ones that were too big and too small and I kind of wish that I hadn't because you can you can keep those bad data points and measure them but um yeah so here's an example like in the First Century A.D the Roman Empire is at its height of power but in The far-flung Outpost of Britannia things are far from stable so this is like hey this is cool young Centurion named Marcus flavius Aquila arrives in Britannia with a mission so this is like a really great story starting off Marcus search for the eagle takes them all over Britannia this is a story that I would read this would be like a great movie um oh my coffee's over here why did I put it over there um yeah so we have like a full story end to end so how did I do this let me explain it to you oh and also sorry um let me zoom in a little bit okay so we will go over the synopsis generator so we will do uh generate synopsis so here's the code it's pretty straightforward so I do seed just to get a little bit of entropy and then for I and list of range 0 to 200 you can just comment this out if you want to just generate one but I was generating bulk data for fine tuning and you probably actually don't want to do this because um I realize that fine tuning um is still uh is still as expensive as it was before and so it is inordinately expensive to do fine tuning compared to just generating data and then discriminating against the data so I'll show you how to do that in just a moment but also I realize that I need to clean up my find and replace a little bit so let's see do replace and then we'll just get rid of semicolons um because what what I did was I'll show you why those are why these are here in just a second because of the prompt beginning middle and then we'll do end being because sometimes it does ending and then we'll do dot replace and we'll do end if it is there oops and then we do remove double spaces okay so that cleans it up okay so it's pretty pretty simple um first I set a unique identifier and so that ends up being here in the under current ID and I did this just so that if you run repeatedly or if you chain it to another thing you know what the last one that you generated was this was when I thought it was going to be part of a pipeline um because if you have multiple steps you want to be able to pass information from run step to the other and I just write it to file you can kind of ignore that if you want um okay so but where were we generate synopsis um yeah so you save the current file and then you uh or first I guess you generate the synopsis all right so here's the function to generate the synopsis so you pick a random genre tone character paste storyline style setting and time um so there's eight different variables and they get piped into this prompt so think like a professional author brainstorm an extremely long complete detailed synopsis for a novel with the following appeal terms oh it's a mouthful um so I gave it a whole bunch of things oh and I also put a uu ID up at the top to just prime it with some some entropy so you multiply all these out and I did have another video describing this but this is a little bit more sophisticated um and also that video kind of stalled anyways so brainstorming extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning middle and end include character and setting names vividly depict the entire novel so this sometimes works and sometimes doesn't the reason that it's sometimes work and sometimes doesn't is because you um in order to get more creativity you got to turn the temperature up um so uh text davinci02 can be good at fiction it can also be God awful um sometimes it just generates a couple of generic boilerplate sentences and sometimes it generates you know the story about um freaking you know Marcus uh Fabius Aquila right like that was a cool story um but this this was the prompt that did that so rather than fine tuning which is really expensive and also Frozen it's rigid um and because then like you might need to fine tune it again um well okay so you generate this uh blah blah you spit it out fine um here let me show you um gpt3 logs date modified one of the most recent one um oh that's the summarization so that's not correct sorry hang on um I was doing some different experiments with like how did how to generate the fine tuning data um but okay so here's an example perfect brainstorming extremely long and this I this prompt um you can tell that it's shorter than the than the current prompt um I added a little bit more detail to get it a little bit more on point because if you tell it that it's a novel one thing that I noticed is that sometimes it thought that it was brainstorming um for a film right which we can do that but the whole the whole point of Auto Muse is to generate novels so I was like let's get more specific so genre science fiction literature setting Scandinavia time period early medieval so here's one problem with having a bunch of different appeal terms that you pick at random sometimes they don't they don't Jive um sometimes they do and it's hilarious there was one where it was like a little boy like a Scandinavian little boy in the third Century comes across a wrecked Viking ship and it's actually a portal to a Sci-Fi World Galaxy and I was like okay that's cool let's roll with it that is some serious mid-grade portal fantasy stuff but you know it fit it it made it figured out a way to make it work um so yeah and year 946 uh Norway is in the midst of a fierce winter um a small village of our rowing a single Viking longship breaks through the ice so you still get like um some weird stuff like this um and so what you want to do is if something is mostly good you want to be able to rate it and so what I figured out was um and this is interesting I've had no less than I think five people now um all comment either in Discord Twitter um or on YouTube about doing generative adversarial networks um and as far as I know it's all been independent so something is happening out in the world where everyone is like let's use gpt3 to do to do Gans and so I was like okay cool let's do that it's not a bad idea and it's something I've had kicking around in my head so um then we I came up with this idea because like okay you get you get a uh oops that's the summary one um so you get a synopsis right um here's a synopsis so you get a synopsis but then like you generate a whole bunch of them and some of them are garbage and some of them aren't so what do you do with it then um what I did was I just said grade the following synopsis on a scale of one to five and I gave it a few shot example of grading them um and so then I gave it uh three different examples synopsis in the fair you know like this is a short one it's not a particularly good one grade one and then here's a much longer one where it gives you names it gives you locations it has a very like it's very Vivid um grade five and then I have a mid length one which is still complete just not quite as much detail in grade three and so then I do you have it spit out another grade um this prompt works really well and so the idea here is that um when you want to generate a synopsis um oh so another thing you can do is I generated a whole bunch at random um to to because my original idea was to fine tune it which you're welcome to do that I've got the fine tuning data here but it costs like thirty dollars to run this fine tune job so that's why I don't recommend it because just in terms of raw token count if I spent that thirty dollars generating synopsis I would have had like 10 000 different synopsis that I could just filter based on criteria rather than spending thirty dollars to fine-tune a single model which I then still have to use at the old price right so in terms of cost efficiency I do not recommend using fine tuning right now I recommend breaking it into multiple steps of ordinary prompts because remember open AI lowered the price of ordinary gpd3 by 66 by two-thirds and fine-tuning is still the original cost so I do not recommend fine tuning right now it is stupid expensive in comparison so what you do is you you can plug in whatever you want here genre setting time period so let me just show you an example of what I mean by this um so we'll go to playground um and please don't copy exactly what I'm about to show you because this could be copyright infringement but imagine that you want like um imagine that you want genre this will be um uh let's see middle grade High fantasy foreign and then you say setting I want it to take place at Hogwarts time period this will be um 1992 story type um so story type uh what was I have a list so the story lines I think oh yeah action-packed character driven intricately plotted issue oriented non-linear um so this would be this we'll do a character driven um so we'll do let's see so character driven story um with uh let's see let's let's say Hermione as the uh Hermione as the protagonist um and then Pace whoops we'll say uh leisurely paced um focusing on Hermione I cannot spell I promise I focusing on Hermione and her studies um character so then the character uh was another set of things where you could just kind of choose um and since she's a familiar character let's see there's 30 different options so we'll say that she's probably like spunky and quirky or whatever um and relatable um Okay so um protagonist is spunky quirky and relatable um she is very smart but struggles socially um tone so the tone is fun so you look at the tones that we have oh and um I pulled most of this from a story guide right here my fiance who's a librarian sent this to me um uh so like well here I can just show you um wait why did that open don't open in that open here there we go so this is this is where I got a lot of these appeal terms so this is basically like library and training um and it's it tells you like what are all the things all the ways that you can describe a book um and so gpt3 knows all these terms and so if you use appeal terms this is what she did her thesis on um if you use appeal terms um like that that phrase appeal terms and then you use these appeal terms gpt3 understands that because it has read a lot about librarianship and book reviews and stuff um let me zoom in a little bit so you can see it better okay so tones so um tones so here's some tones like steamy strong sense of play suspenseful some of y'all will want to generate steamy fan fiction and have at it um I'm just showing you the way if you want to be sinful do that on time but the tone that I'm going to do is going to be I'm going to choose Whimsical and um let's see let's see Whimsical and nostalgic there we go nostalgic um this is fan fiction for revisiting someone's favorite character um and then finally style so style was writing style so this is the writing style which is like how do you want it to how do you want it to be written um and so we'll probably do um we don't want it to be gritty let's see um Hermione is very analytical so it would probably be richly detailed um so we'll do like richly detailed and um and thoughtful okay and actually I probably should change this to writing style um because if you just say style um it might not be clear um like what like yeah that it's that it's at okay so writing style what did I say it was going to be um oh witty yeah so witty thoughtful and richly detailed particularly detailed it should it is um first POV from Hermione's perspective okay so now this is this is something that like you could just put in randomly to get whatever story you want and we'll turn this temperature up to one because that's the most you can do in the playground we'll turn that up to 2000 so that it can just write and now let's see what it generates um so she's starting her first year um let's see as Hermione begins her study she quickly realized she's a natural at Magic oh this is really long that had a very long First Act oh so you might have noticed um that I had to specify beginning middle and end so here's the thing is if you say synopsis here's the thing is the term synopsis is supposed to just kind of wet your palate for a story and not contain any spoilers and so that's why I had to specify give me a synopsis with beginning middle and end so it summarizes the whole story um the The Professor Severus Snape the potions master so this actually probably didn't work that well because it's just like summarizing Harry Potter because it knows it too well um but with Sirius Black safely in the present oh this is interesting so it's um yeah it's basically like kind of re-re-making um uh different different aspects of Harry Potter she eventually goes on to Mary Ron and have two children um okay so this is this is basically just kind of like proposing Harry Potter but from Hermione's perspective um excuse me so anyways you get the idea where you you fill in the blanks and you get a story that you want um this one this this worked uh pretty well actually so you see how long and complete this is um probably if I gave it a little bit more um details about like change this about it like if you want a fan fiction generator but um you see that this works just fine and uh yeah actually that's probably about it for um how far are we we're a whole 20 minutes in okay so you get the idea how the synopsis generator Works let's move on to the plot generator so the plot generator is exactly once again exactly what it says on the 10. so let me close these and we'll open plot generator material so the plot generator takes a synopsis and then generates um and then generates a plot outline for it so let me show you so there's that and then so I just copied all those synopses that I generated and then I generated a whole mess of plots from them and so what I did was and let me show you the uh The Prompt because that'll help it make the most sense uh prompt outline okay so imagine a detailed plot outline for the following novel and then you give it the synopsis here and I say use the following beat sheet to outline the novel and gpt3 knows save the cat so this is um save the cat is uh let's see describe save the cat um oh writes a novel and great detail this book is about no it is not what is the save the cat plot structure there we go um okay so we say list all the uh plot beats for Save the cat and so you see it knows all of these plot beats and so this is basically a formula that you can use to generate any plot so the the key Insight that I had was rather than just having gpt3 right like a panther which is just writing by this if it's pants if you give it structure and then explore each of those structures and kind of expand it over time so you start with a race solid synopsis and then from that synopsis you generate a really good plot and then from that plot you generate a whole bunch of really good scenes and then from those scenes you generate scripts and then from those scripts you generate Pros right so it's a see this chain of expansions but the problem and I got um I got a I got up to the level of scene generator but that's where it fell apart even with summarization it can't really it doesn't really understand what it's trying to do without a lot of fine tuning and so it's going to be really expensive but then you also run out of window size because with fine tuning you're limited to 2000 tokens which you'll run out of real fast anyways that was a little bit of a tangent so here's an example of a prompt outline so detailed.novel outline each beat should be a paragraph long I probably actually ought to change this um this prompt to make it a little bit uh better um synopsis generator prompt synopsis uh let's see writing style and then story tone fix those okay and then uh what did I say change the um outline yeah okay so brainstorm an extremely long high detailed plot synopsis yeah and then I'll say um let's let's borrow the same language so brainstorm a long uh a highly detailed um lot outline for this novel um each plot beat should be a paragraph long and instruct often doesn't know that but I found that if you include this it'll usually do at least like two maybe three sentences whereas if you don't include that um it will only be like uh like one sentence long um and so then what I did I did the same thing where I created a way of grading it so like sometimes it'll just spit out like a few plot beats and I'm like no this is garbage give me an actual plot like full and so then here's a much longer one which is like okay this is something we can work with um so that's grade five and then if it has all the plot beats but they're only one sentence long then it's grade three and so what you can do is you can given the same input you can keep generating plot outlines with high temperature until you get one that's grade five um and so then again that's gonna that's still going to be way cheaper than um than fine tuning right now um now one thing that I did find in in another experiment and I probably can go ahead and open source this because it ultimately didn't work so I guess I don't mind sharing it um so let me go ahead and set this the plotter novel writer um this so change visibility make it public so this one you can take a look at um it basically uh it got pretty far but it's still like it just it lost the plot all the time but what I found was that if you switch to original DaVinci original DaVinci is way better at writing fiction because the um the instruct series was not trained to write efficient um so it's usually really garbage at it but because our original Da Vinci is not fine-tuned if you give it a chunk of prose it'll just take that chunk of pros and run with it and so if you explore these I was working on an idea of like basic outlines and advanced outlines and then um you know it's kind of smushing it all together and this is this is a hot mess if you want to take the time to um to dig through it um I've I've unlocked the video where I was explaining this um let's see where is the one I think it was here oh yeah so if you look at this file I'm not going to say it out loud um but look at this uh this was the one that worked the best um and so you see the whole process of it of it trying to go through and then it gets too long but this story was really weird it was it was really dark um but it was it actually like touched in on like I don't know I was reading it as it was being generated I'm like okay I'm really on to something here um but this was like one out of ten worked a little bit and then because so remember I was saying like you kept I kept running out of tokens like even with summarization you cannot get a full-length novel you could probably do a novella like up to maybe 20 000 words with a with a shorter uh plot structure but gp3 cannot do full-length novels yet um I tried and tried and tried to get enough material in this um maybe you could do a little bit better with fine tuning um so that way you you just give it a few data points and I can write but yeah so it's not it's not going to work um anyways yeah so those are the those are the three things that I wanted to um kind of bring you up to speed on so Auto Muse is alive and well I don't believe that this is going to disrupt the market I don't think I'm going to lose any friends over it because really all that I've got working as a synopsis generator and a plot outline generator and that's like that's pretty formulaic um okay I think that's it so thanks for watching um like And subscribe and consider
