hey everybody David Shapiro here um yeah so I was really excited to work on um earlier I was working on my novel writer and I had uh from a previous experiment I had uh 200 different premises and I was like okay that's good but uh we can do better so I was talking to my fiance who is um a librarian by training and an Avid Reader and so she sent me this document which has a list of all kinds of appeal terms and then what I did was I went to um I went to Wikipedia and then I also went to TV tropes and I got lists upon lists of genres um so I took all that together and I made a bunch of files so we've got uh character types we've got genres we've got 192 genres three different Paces um I did 31 settings um I did 11 storyline types 24 Styles 39 time periods 53 tones and so you multiply all that together and we have 292 billion different combinations for stories um I wanted to make sure I got every possible type of story now this excludes um video games and a few other things but uh yeah so this is a lot so we can get we can get most story lines in here um and then I stuffed it all into a prompt so brainstorm an extremely long complete detailed synopsis for a story with the following appeal terms genre setting time period story type Pace character tone style so this should cover all of literary literature and film and TV um but uh well most of it um extremely long and highly detailed complete plot synopsis with beginning middle and end okay so I got that and then I generated um I've generated more than this but these are these are the the current ones that are that are pretty good and so what I did was I stuff it all so you get all the appeal terms right at the top and then here's the story um you know appeal term swashbuckler in Australia in the 21st century believable intensifying conversational Moody and plot driven so in the year 2020 Smosh buckler adventurers still exist and Australia is their playground 21 year old Lara Croft despite all of my effort gbt3 still spits out existing um character names anyways we'll fine-tune this eventually one day is the daughter of one such adventure and has always dreamed of following in her Father's Footsteps her father is killed on an exposition in the outback um despairing she travels to Australia to bury her father and sell off all his things and the small town of Millbrook she meets an old man etc etc okay so let's just give you an example no come here generate synopsis so cooking stories in Korea in the 23rd Century open-ended intensifying religiously diverse steamy and stylistically complex um so let's see yeah this is like a 1 in 292 billion possibility um it's taking a minute to generate so I'm wondering how long it's going to be okay so it is the 23rd Century in the world is a very different place and Korea a smaller and more densely populated country than it is today the main form of transportation is by maglev the cooking style of country has also changed relying heavily on what can be grown in vertical Gardens and hydroponic Farms now that's cool one day a young woman named Sue Min is on her way to work as a chef at a famous restaurant in Seoul so this is 23rd Century Seoul um she's from a small town and is not used to the hustle and bustle of the city she's waiting for her train she notices a handsome man also waiting on the train they make eye contact and there's an instant spark of Attraction all right there's the steamy bit um at the restaurant suman's boss assigns her to task of preparing a special disc for a very important customer the customer is a religious leader from another country interesting who is visiting Korea on a diplomatic Mission so you see how all these different appeal factors get woven in so it's a cooking story that takes place in Korea in the 23rd century and there's a religious uh character so there's a you know the antagonist that seems like there might be some religious tension it's intensifying and stylistically complex and then the steamy bit gotta gotta get that in there um let's see to complicate matters further she is also told that she must use only ingredients that are available in the country which means that she will have to get creative interesting so one thing that I'm noticing is that um when I came to this um some I probably ought to maintain the descriptions for these because I I what I did was I oversimplified it so you know like um scary is obvious sardonic is you know some of some of these are kind of obvious but they're not always obvious so like character if a character is Sassy um you know these books feature characters that are usually women with outsized personality and bottomless well of one-liners and comebacks you know so there is um but particularly the writing style and tone right so if it's incisive like these keenly Discerning books cut right to the heart of the matter right just by adding a little bit more that will cue that'll tell gpt3 what to do and I think that that'll definitely help with writing style character and tone so what I might do is I might go back and add some of this information back in but here let me do a quick time check yeah we're only five minutes I'll pause it and add those back in and we'll see if it helps okay so I went and updated um all the appeal terms well not all of them but some of them so on the characters same number but I just added a little bit better description so it'll prime the pump a little bit more so to speak genres that's the same I de-duplicated it um so it's 192. originally it was over 300 um and then so for the pace got fast paced intensifying leisurely paced settings and of course there's so many more settings I could put in lists of cities towns actually that's not a bad idea um small town rural somewhere uh big city life um then story lines action-packed character driven so on and so forth with um with a little bit more description so again giving it just a little bit more verbiage to chew on um so that gpt3 knows what to do with it um styles so the Style by by adding a little bit more about style you're going to get something a little bit better time periods and then tones so creepily creepy like unsetting in a visceral skin crawling way all right so we generated one uh black exploitation parity on another planet alternative timeline story type action-packed pulse pounding is the rule Pace intensifying character introspective these characters examine their own feelings tone hopeful while addressing weighty issues these books incorporate some optimistic elements style gritty characterized by a narrative style that includes dark and unsettling details um so then the appeal terms that's a big chunk beginning back on Earth in the early 21st century oh boy okay was a hugely popular movie fan franchise uh the film's chronically Adventures of the vampire Blacula who's from another planet in the first film Blacula arrives on the earth and imposition by the evil dracul garage door opener company what Blacula quickly realizes he is not welcome on Earth so he realizes that he's he returns to his home planet uh I might have thrown too much of League of drainy super powered beings this is very strange okay let's run this again I might have thrown too much at it all right so superhero literature big city life um in the 17th century World building uh Pace intensifying characters Twisted um let's see what else did we get um tone disturbing uh style dialect filled okay in a distant Galaxy I wonder why it said distant Galaxy that's fine um in a distant Galaxy an energy being known as the one has been narrowly defeated by a brave band of Heroes known as the Vanguard I guess it does say superhero um it's fascinating and then World building okay um let's see let's see okay so it's just kind of regurgitating some of the St oh wait no that's those are the things that I told it to do okay the one unleashes his fury on the heroes killing all of them except for one an amnesiac girl who the heroes had rescued from a nearby Planet okay the caretaker um cool the girl who is who takes the name of Sarah quickly assimilates to life on Earth she soon discovers that she has superpowers okay so that's a cool origin story Sarah must find and rally the people of Earth to stop the one excellent um yeah Sarah travels back in time but it's too late the Vanguard has already defeated the one and about to kill the last remaining member um Sarah herself oh cool so it does it does integrate that time travel bit fascinating okay let's do this uh one more time and we'll call it a day um let's see science fiction England in the third Century um own voices um share marginalized uh identity pace is intensifying and character sarcastic um tone is explicit lots of vividly described sex okay that's pretty spicy um and then slang heavy Sabrina is a 20 something year old woman and lives in England during the third Century she eats out a living as a okay I'm not going to say that out loud um servicing Roman soldiers who are stationed nearby yeah okay um so this is one thing that I really don't like about uh about um the fine-tuned is that there's so many typos in the training data for gpt3 instruct that they end up in this and it's because it's because they paid a whole bunch of contractors to just generate a bunch of content um so anyways side tangent um let's see but they can help her Escape her current lifestyle if she's willing to work for him Okay so Sabrina is initially hesitant but the man is persistent and eventually agrees to work for him he tells her that his name is Lucius and that he's a member of a secret society that is working to overthrow the Roman Empire now that's cool all right you got my attention he tells her that they need someone with her knowledge of the city and the people in it to help carry out their plans oh this is this is uh some Espionage Sabrina is apprehensive but excited she agrees to help him and over the next few months becomes an invaluable asset to their cause she helps them to gather information about the city and the people in it and who to trust she develops feelings for Lucius which complicates matters that's where it gets spicy eventually leads to the group downfall um Sabrina is captured and imprisoned oh wow everyone is executed that's horrible um and she thinks she wonders what she could have done to do make things differently she's executed and the Roman Empire continues to rule England for centuries to come wow okay that's really heavy um yep definitely intensifying um I guess I I yeah the the idea of Science Fiction was kind of overruled by everything else um but yeah okay that's yeah that's we've got we've got something that can generate some pretty intense plots here um and so then as I alluded to at the beginning of this I am writing uh or sorry working on a plot writing or a novel writing thing um but you need a premise to start you need that seed that kernel and so by having something that can generate 292 billion different um arrays of appeal factors oh and also I can make it I can we can do even more let me show you because what I'm doing here um is with generate plot synopsies I'm just grabbing one of each of those you can get multiple tones multiple characters multiple storyline Styles and so on so yeah there's you can you can easily just continue to um to add add to this so like for instance um let's see settings uh let's see across the whole uh planet right so you just add one more thing because there's plenty of settings you can do there's plenty of time periods although I got I got pretty much all of you know from everything from ancient history Mythic period up through like far future uh distant future alternative timelines and so on um but yeah so I think I'll call it a day I'm very satisfied with this um this is uh clearly very useful um gets status get add kind of get commit am um all done so this is this is a very useful like you could you could also just call this a uh um a uh uh writing prompt right so this is my epic writing prompt generator you can run this every day for for many years and you'll never get the same one so another thing that happens is because I use a uuid and a high temperature even if you run the same exact uh plot or a set of appeal factors through it you're not going to get the same same uh plot synopsis twice so technically you have an infinite number of plots in this plot generator sorry that's the plot that's the novel writer but the pla synopsis generator technically you can get an infinite array of uh of stories okay cool well I'm satisfied with this um uh yeah once I get so a little bit in case you're curious about where I'm going with some of this stuff this is there's there's a reason there's a method to my madness so I've got the um the synopsis generator the the novel writer that does that uses the plotter method um one other thing that I worked on was the creative writing coach um so the creative writing coach was this actually this was an idea that came from Reddit where someone wanted some uh something to provide feedback okay well so what happens when you when you get a manuscript so uh it'll only take another couple of days worth of work I think to get this to generate a full manuscript I've been taking notes about how to expand each section um so then you get a manuscript but what if it's garbage right um that's that's been the big problem with uh AI generated stuff is that it's garbage and it's because and to be fair a lot of human first drafts are garbage so that means we need to integrate a cycle of of iterative improvement of refinement and that is where I'm going to take my previous work on a creative writing coach to provide feedback and so the idea is that you this this repo the plotter novel will just generate a manuscript the idea is to get between 50 and 100 000 words that's most stories um uh it's it's much harder to handle longer stories like up to 300 000 words but the definition of a novel is 50 to 60 000 words um and if you say that's an average of um a thousand words per scene so that's 50 to 60 scenes that's not the hardest thing in the world so that's what I'm aiming for for the first version but then once you get a manuscript it's an entirely different process to make it better so the goal here is to generate a manuscript just barf it out as you know uh whatever whatever you put in and that's where the synopsis comes in so step one come up with a synopsis step two generate a manuscript step three make it better so that's what I'm working on um and who knows uh we're only a month and a half away from Nano genmo so maybe I will just spit out a whole bunch of uh of uh automatically generated novels for uh November for Nano nanogenmo nanowrimo good morning I'm really excited because this I I have a feeling that this is gonna work um you know I've been playing around with gpt3 for a couple years now um and I've been experimenting with cognitive architectures and and you know I'm I'm not I'm not even a semi-pro author I've spent more money as an author than I've made as an author um but I Do It For the Love of the art um and so now I'm going to try and pour everything that I know about making stories into making them automatically and we'll see how it goes um the idea that there might be an infinite number of stories out there to um to to uh to write for people um because some people like you know yeah all right anyways I'm rambling I'm gonna stop there um I hope you enjoyed this uh please feel free to use uh the synopsis generator um and just yeah run with it all right talk to everyone later
