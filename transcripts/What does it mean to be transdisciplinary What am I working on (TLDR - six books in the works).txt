hey everyone david shapiro here with a video um you might have noticed that my videos are a little bit more sparse lately and the reason is because i've got three non-fiction books that i'm working on getting out of the door as well as my trilogy and i think it's time to really knuckle down and get those i've achieved a lot of my research goals and my research will continue [Music] in terms of artificial cognition um and that's actually one of the books that i'm writing i'm also writing a book on philosophy and um and a few other things so anyways the point of today's video is i wanted to talk about the difference between being multi-disciplinary interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary so multi-disciplinary and i apologize if i get these these definitions wrong multi-disciplinary is when you have a team where every individual has one specialization and they all contribute to the same problem interdisciplinary is when you have disparate dis disciplines coming together to transform and create a new discipline but it's still individuals and then when you're transdisciplinary it is when you as an individual merge many disciplines and and then create something new and so that's what i'm doing um with artificial cognition and so what i wanted to do was share my bookcase um so here on the top shelf i've got all kinds of books on neuroscience and well mostly neuroscience on this side and then i've also got a whole lot of psychology and and other aspects of the mind so top shelf i've got psychology and neuroscience and mental health and i have read pretty much well yeah all the books almost all the books on that shelf with just accepting a couple here and there um my second bookshelf is so here on the left i've got um i've got social sciences and history um i have i have there's a few of these that i haven't gotten to yet but i have also read most of these and then i've also got business books um and then i've got some other random stuff here at the end and i'll say that you know psychology and neuroscience um is you know that's pretty obvious in terms of how it relates to creating artificial general intelligence or artificial cognition and so like when you look at artificial intelligence from the perspective of say evolution and neuroscience and biology it looks very different than when excuse me when you look at it from the perspective of math and science and coding now i what's not reflected on this bookshelf is my 15 years of experience in technology and so what i'm doing is i'm becoming a transdisciplinary inventor i guess and that i'm bringing 15 years of my professional experience with systems engineering which is getting large complex systems of network of networks and computers to communicate to produce outcomes and that's exactly what i'm doing with artificial cognition i'm viewing intelligence as a system not as a monolith and so you combine you know social science and psychology and neuroscience and business and all my professional experience with that and you get uh a different perspective my third shelf is uh fiction i've got a little bit more fiction over here and i will say that fiction is important because fiction is a really great way to kind of fertilize your mind but my the other part of my bottom shelf this is all about spirituality philosophy and mysticism um and so i've also read i once again i've pretty much read almost all of this bookcase with a few exceptions here and there and so you know one of the reasons that i'm writing a book on philosophy is because i am merging everything that i've learned about evolution and neuroscience and biology with everything that i've learned about philosophy for the philosophy of science the philosophy of information and it's almost like this is a necessary step in order to say like this is the underpinning philosophy behind the ethics and morality that i am working on for artificial cognition and there's this like there's this expansiveness that happens that that i noticed was happening because every time i would get to an impasse with designing artificial cognition and designing these systems i was like wait i need to learn more about this because for instance with my core objective functions or the heroes to comparatives um it's like okay i had the intuition that you know reduce suffering and increase prosperity and increase understanding was good but i needed to back it up like why and so then you know i went and read all kinds of books brain trust by patricia churchlin was a really good one on task by david bader all these other books and i was like okay yes now i understand that these are actually good objective functions for an artificial entity and now i can back it up and say why um and everything that i have learned either professionally or through these books or through my independent research all comes together in the design of artificial cognition so anyways i just wanted to give this update and explain that you know you probably won't see many coding videos they'll probably still happen here and there as i'm doing experiments to write about in my book so one book that i'm working on is called useless platitudes and truisms it is a book of proverbs and quotations and i just submitted that to get test printed yesterday so hopefully i'll get a copy of physical copy of that back in the next few weeks that book is it was mostly a joke the the point of it was i love quotations and proverbs um they serve as like little tiny verbal reminders of like how to live and how to solve problems and so i scraped together about five or six hundred different proverbs and quotations the first draft i tried to make it with gpt3 and i ended up having to rewrite the whole thing so it was originally going to be touted as you know this was a book written by ai but it was too formulaic and so i had to you know make give it my own touch um the book on artificial cognition that i'm working on is symphony of thought where i will be documenting the microservices architecture and all the reasoning and philosophy behind it as well as um actually you know recording the results the actual demonstration so it's not just going to be you know abstract theory it'll be this is this is what i built this is how it worked this is what didn't work and this is why um so that's symphony of thought um my other book the philosophy one is called post nihilism uh philosophy for the 21st century so the short version of that is that we are in the midst of what i call the nihilistic crisis uh the nihilistic crisis is being driven by four primary um uh phenomena in society uh the first uh is childhood abandonment and that is most uh commonly seen with children that are in my when i was little it was we were abandoned in front of uh tv screens um but today it's video games and tablets and and interactive you know online stuff um but you know childhood emotional neglect i found a study that said that um 20 of adults rep report that they were emotionally neglected as children although this study did say that um that these numbers uh likely under represent the actual truth um so that's childhood abandonment the the second uh driving force of the nihilistic crisis is um is social abandonment which we see in you know all the complaints about like the anti-work movement and people that are feeling left behind because rent is is you know unattainable buying a house is unattainable good jobs are unattainable so those are all symptoms of social abandonment where we're not looking out for each other anymore the third driver of the nihilistic crisis is uh is cosmic abandonment which was caused or symptomatic of the rise of secularism and so i'm not saying you know like oh well we all just need to go back to church no what i'm saying is that is that old paradigms of spirituality are not working for us anymore and so we need a new paradigm of spirituality hence all the books on spirituality that i've read so i've got some ideas about how to reform our approach to spirituality which will help alleviate that third abandonment the cosmic abandonment and finally the last phase of the nihilistic crisis is self-abandonment and self-abandonment comes when you give up hope right it is um it is the my the quagmire of hopelessness and despair and we see this it is most symptomatic it is most worse when you see particularly teenagers becoming school shooters and it's that is a that is a crisis of of hopelessness of i'm in pain and i don't see any relief so i'm just going to share my pain um from a philosophical perspective from a cultural perspective and i know this is an oversimplification right there are many reasons that mass shootings happen and it's not just teenagers who commit them um but in general um from a philosophical perspective that's kind of what i think is going on and that is only one symptom that is the most egregious symptom but there are other symptoms of of self-abandonment so for instance deaths from despair are on the rise which is things like drug overdoses alcoholism and suicide are all on the rise and part of that is self-abandonment where someone gives up hope and they don't see any purpose to their life and so that is the nihilistic crisis and that is uh that is the book that i'm uh or post nihilism is the book that i'm writing to that proposes how do we move past this phil on a philosophical and spiritual and intellectual level but also post nihilism is the under underpinning philosophy behind my design of artificial cognition and specifically the core objective functions which i now call the heuristic imperatives which is once again reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding um i might be wrong but uh it makes sense to me and people that i talk to about it say it makes sense i mean one of my best friends is a uh is a philosopher turned physicist and she's like yeah i am proudly a post nihilist when we talked about it so maybe i'm onto something not everyone's gonna get it that's fine um but yeah so this video ended up being longer than i wanted it to be i just wanted to give an update as to what i'm working on and why and so i've got six books that i'm working on i'm gonna get as many of them done as i can and then i'll be back to presenting on youtube more regularly obviously showing you the books that i'm writing that's really boring so anyways thanks for watching take care like and subscribe etc etc
