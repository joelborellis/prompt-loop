hey everybody david shapiro here i just tried to record this video and the sound was broken so let's try that again um first uh i wanted to give a community update so i created the cognitive ai lab discord server um a few months ago just basically by popular demand um and it has grown rapidly to uh just over 200 members um and but i was getting burned out so i just got back from vacation and um i did some soul searching while i was on vacation and um many many of you on the community told me like you do a lot you should take care of yourself y'all were right um so after doing some soul searching on during my vacation i decided that um it was it was time to step down from the server but i also knew that a lot of people have commented on how unique this community is and that they want to see it keep going so i uh made it made an announcement on the community that i really wanted to step down i needed to step away so that i can focus on my research and my writing um and then i had more than half a dozen people message me saying like we will help run this like we will take over um i had people volunteering to take ownership people volunteering to administer and moderate the server um and so what we're basically what we're doing is um over the next uh you know days and maybe a week or two we'll be doing kind of a transition as we decide the new structure and then i'll i'll hand the reins over i'm going to let go i am a big believer in community and consensus and open source um and and just uh distribution of power um and so i'm i'm i'm gonna put up or shut up i'm gonna you know demonstrate that i believe in that and i'm gonna eventually step down um entirely i'll just be a normal normal community member um so yeah that's a community update um there's uh once that's done we'll probably open the doors again you know as more people come in we're gonna have better moderation and so on uh but yeah so then i wanted to plug a couple of books so first is my upcoming book useless platitudes and truisms this is a book of proverbs that uh that i wrote because i love proverbs they help me um they help me remember how to think um and how to approach the world so i what i what i wanted was a book that i could just flip to a random page and find a piece of wisdom because you don't always know what you need but you flip to a random page and you get a couple pearls of wisdom so what uh example page 72 it'd probably be different because this is a print test um correlation does not imply causation um so it's a great that's a great uh maxim to to live by another one silence is powerful you can speak volumes with a closed mouth do not answer to lies slandering and needling do not dignify maliciousness with a response so hold your tongue sometimes um there's similar quotations to that uh so for instance another one is uh least said soon as mended so like your tongue um silent uh uh speech is silver but silence is golden i love love love these anyways so look for this i'll have an announcement once this is fully ready it's going to be on barnes noble and it's just a little pocketbook size another book that i wanted to recommend i just got this in the mail from thriftbooks it's a conversation or sorry consensus through conversation how to achieve high commitment decisions consensus is something that i use both professionally and personally and it is tremendous i cannot recommend consensus enough i think that if everyone abided by consensus and collaborative mindsets the world would be a better place so what is what do i mean by consensus consensus in this case is a is a formalized structure um so the way that the way that meetings happen now is called what is it like robert's rules or whatever um so like where everyone like gets in a room and there's a clear power structure and then there's a vote and then you move on you move you move on very quickly um that favors things like extraversion assertiveness aggression and it's also a winner takes all approach and it is so deeply embedded in our culture that um that we everyone just follows by that and doesn't realize that there's a better way the better way is consensus once you learn about consensus so the coolest thing about consensus is that you can implement it without other people knowing and that might sound unethical but let me tell you why this works so one thing is that with consensus you can take the consensus of the room and encourage people to speak up so one way that you can implement consensus for instance if you're in a meeting or whatever is you just you call on someone you say i haven't heard from you um like what are your thoughts um and so you're basically making yourself the de facto facilitator and you can do that especially if the meeting doesn't have any any leaders in it or if the leaders create space so facilitation is critical for consensus and you know a manager should do that not always you might have a project manager or a team lead who should do that but you create space for people and you deliberately pull everyone into the conversation to get their input and you you ask a few primed questions or loaded questions like what problems do you see with this or is there anything we're missing right you ask people these questions and you get everyone to participate and more often than not you'll be surprised by new information that comes out consensus works really well um for it works exceptionally well for small groups but it still works particularly well for couples um because what you do is you find a solution that that that it's not just something that you reluctantly agree to where it's like one person wants one thing enthusiastically and the other person's like okay whatever the biggest thing of consensus and collaborative decision making is that you work towards a solution that you're both enthusiastic about that everyone buys into fully and it takes creativity it takes creativity it takes negotiation but you have to reach for some you have sometimes you have to reach for solutions that are not immediately obvious and that's where consensus really shines because it in it encourages everyone to put in their full brain trust their full brain power which means that you'll come up with better solutions as a group whether it's a group of two or a group of eight or whatever than anyone could come up with alone so i want to recommend consensus i cannot recommend it enough and this is also the underpinning philosophy behind some of these changes with the server um yeah so if you want to join um i don't know what we're going to do with with the uh the doors um because all the all the current links have expired but once we get the community rejiggered we will um we will make sure that people can keep coming well i don't know i'm not gonna be in control this is what i think is gonna happen um anyways i'm rambling now so this has been a brief update as to what i'm working on um as well as what's going on with the community um i do have three other books other than this one that i'm working on i've got symphony of thought which is another book on artificial intelligence it is all the different components that you need to create artificial cognition such as cognitive control planning executive function that sort of stuff another book that i'm working on is called post nihilism it is a commentary on the zeitgeist of today and what where where we need to go forward from here or rather the problems that we need to solve i don't know where it's going to go but i'm going to focus entirely on the problems and then the last book that i'm working on is the first novel in my trilogy which i will i'll be talking with an editor tomorrow to see if it's a good fit so lots of exciting things to work on and lots of things coming so again thanks for watching and thanks for all the support everyone has been phenomenal and i am really excited about where the community is going to go from here because again i'm a huge i absolutely believe in consensus and this it's high time that i stepped down as a as a leader of the community so anyways um thanks for watching take care
