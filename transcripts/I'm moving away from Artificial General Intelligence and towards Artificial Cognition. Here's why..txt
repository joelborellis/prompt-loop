okay so i've got to go in just a couple minutes but i wanted to record a very quick video mostly just a test um but yeah so i am rapidly shifting away from using the term artificial general intelligence i don't think it's particularly helpful or useful the first reason is that intelligence is such a vague squishy concept it's not a behavior it's an attribute or a characteristic and it's a poorly defined one at that so what is artificial general intelligence it's it's such a vague concept and the goal posts keep getting moved on it now in the meantime i have been researching and building what i'm coming to call artificial cognition i mean i wrote a book called natural language cognitive architecture that's what it does it performs cognition cognition is something that is much more objective it's much more measurable uh but also it's it's a behavior and it's something that is easy to characterize and observe uh and therefore it's a lot easier to work on and talk about because agi is so vague so squishy so you know it means everything to everyone whoops means everything to everyone whereas oops that's my time to go whereas artificial cognition is a lot more specific and i think it's ultimately going to be a lot more helpful so anyways that's just a quick update about my work and where i'm heading
