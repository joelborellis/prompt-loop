hey everybody david shapiro here with a video this is going to be another tutorial on prompt engineering today uh so in the first prompt engineering video we talked about davinci which was the original heavy duty model right here da vinci but what today we're going to talk about text davinci o2 which is one of the instruct series models so when i say instruct series models what do i what am i talking about it's this right here so january of this year openai published this blog post about um about their their uh their their instruct series models and all the most popular models today are the text davinci text curie these are all fine-tuned to follow instructions so if you want to follow or to figure this out you can see uh it's right here openai.com blogs instruction following i'll have a link in the comments as well so just a little bit of background about the history of where we're at so the behavior of text davincio 2 is going to be very very different from da vinci from plain vanilla da vinci almond and da vinci instruct beta so the instruct series are fine-tuned um to do quite a few tasks and so i just took a couple quick notes about different kinds of tasks so what we're going to do is i just clicked on one of the random wikipedia articles of the day and i'll just copy this in and this will be our this will be our our fodder for uh for today um so let's start with one task which is uh summarization or paraphrasing um so i'll just say summarize so you need an imperative verb so an imperative verb is a command a command or imperative tells it what to do that is the instruction so i'll say summarize the following article and then also let's turn the temperature down to zero so zero makes the model deterministic which means it'll give us the same output every time so if you change one little thing you'll see a difference so what i do often is i'll do at least two new lines i'll say article so one thing is if you capitalize something it's a different set of tokens um which which kind of tells the model like oh pay attention to this this is not normal language this is not part of the article you can also do stuff like adding you know um those it kind of that can cut sometimes kind of confuse it so then you just say then go to the very end and they say summary and then we'll do control enter all right so you see the irish bee conservation project is a charitable organization etc etc um so let's just copy this out and i'll save it and then we'll change one thing at a time and i'll show you what i mean so first let's run it again just just to see that it generates the same exact um uh output or at least it look no did it do something a little bit different interesting yeah it gave me a different output what did i do differently it's supposed to be deterministic let me run this again did i fat finger something i wonder if i fat fingered something on the first one because this looks identical to the second run let's do it let's do it one more time just to be sure okay that's a little bit different too i wonder if the temperature no longer has the same impact okay this is the same as the first one oops interesting okay so it seems to be flip-flopping between two outputs okay so that's slightly unexpected anyways so let's go so we've got that we've got these instructions and we see that it generates um those two things so now let's let's change let's do a summarize the following article very concisely so cons using adjectives modifying the instructions with adjectives will uh will change the output so then we'll just say concise summary so this word activates different parts of the gpd3 model that it says okay what does concise mean it means make it smaller so now let's see the temperature is still zero so let's see see how much shorter it is uh and we'll run this a couple times so we have 829 characters versus 298. um oops control z redo and the the first bit is is almost identical right you see that where it just adds more so basically telling it to be concise cut it off at the knees um let's run it again looks like it's pretty much identical yep okay so telling it to be concise that does one thing now what if we what if we take the temperature and turn it up to one so this is how i learned all this stuff is i just said okay let me just i've got this i've got this little panel of of knobs and levers let me just experiment with them and see what happens so now that the temperature is up to one we're going to see a lot more variants oh it still has concise so it actually gave me the same output so i'll have to remove concise yeah that's the same same output all right so let's remove concise summary uh summarize the following article and also it's one thing is that's important to keep in mind is that this is a fine-tuned model so its output is going to be much more consistent in general than um ordinary davinci oh interesting okay so this is one problem with uh with the instruct series is that they do tend to be a little bit more deterministic or less less random there we go so this gave us a completely different um different output also part of the problem is that this is a is a relatively short or um not organization uh article which means that there's not a whole lot to do okay you get the idea we've done a little bit of summarization let's move on to another whoops cancel that um let's see classification rewriting i'm not sure if there's any classification that we can do with this however there is a lot of keyword extraction named entity recognition and dates um so let's see uh perform any r uh and um and date extraction on the following article and so then we say list all named entities and dates and then one thing i often do is because i want it to be a list i'll just i'll go to the new line and start with a dash because that is like a final little thing that says this is the list because sometimes the model will get confused and it'll just describe it as a paragraph it's like no give me a list there we go hey not bad so it gives me beltane living earth festival southeast technology instrument university 21st baron of dunsini um i could have sworn there was some dates in here there's 2020 2021 so it missed a few dates but that's okay if we turn the well i'm not going to worry about the temperature you've seen you've seen that there's different things that it can do but it did do a good job of extracting name entities and dates let's see what else can we do let's go back to my list um brainstorming rewriting classification oh here we go rewrite the following wikipedia article um uh so that it's more interesting from a uh let's see so it's more interesting for um an online um news article so then uh rewrite to be interesting and so you know you might you might your intuition might be like well a machine doesn't know what interesting is the machine doesn't need to understand what interesting really means all it has to do is match the pattern of what what it has read in hundreds of gigabytes of other text of what humans find interesting look at this this is great copy and then if it cut off because the maximum length so let's let it finish its article it's probably just about done yeah so in this case you can see it's pretty similar um but it has expanded on a lot of the stuff quite a bit um in some cases it's kind of just regurgitating what it what it um what it read up top um but it has definitely adopted um slightly new formats rewarded it just a little bit um to make it a a bit more interesting a little a little less dry and academic so rewriting is is another thing that it can do um let's see let's see rewrite the following wikipedia article so that it is let's say so it is more accessible to children so then let's come here rewrite for children so you see it's it's still got really similar information but instead of like pillars of support it just says there are four things the charity does to help bees so the language has been simplified um and and some of the some of the irrelevant details have been have been removed um let's see let's see rewrite the following wikipedia article let's just do something off the wall um in esperanto um let's see if it knows esperanto it might not rewrite in esperanto i have no idea if that's actually esperanto um it did something okay cool um let's see and uh in oh what is it there's um bbc was it bbc pigeon um i'm pretty sure they're like bbc has like a section that is now okay um oh wait hang on let's see let's say a west african um pigeon so basically what i'm remembering sorry i kind of trailed off is uh bbc started um yeah there it is okay so it does understand pidgin so this is like a kind of a simplified english um that is uh that is uh popular in some parts of africa um and so you see that like um fricatives like the has been replaced with duh dat um way day limited by guaranteed that same year e design and install yeah so it's a kind of the simplified english so by by saying rewrite um so one thing is in that's interesting is if you say translate for whatever reason gpth3 often gets confused when you say translate but if you tell it to rewrite it says okay i'm going to start from scratch and rewrite it in this other way let me do a quick time check we're at 12 minutes okay so we didn't get through too much but i showed you some really cool things that you can do with gpt3 including summarization rewriting extraction and named entity recognition we also did a little bit of parameter tweaking so we'll call that a day
