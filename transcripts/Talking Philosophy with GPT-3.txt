hey everyone let's do some philosophy with gpt3 what is a simple definition of nihilism that's my favorite topic like uh lately nihilism is the belief that nothing has meaning or value lovely what is a simple definition of humanism humanism is a philosophy that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings individually and collectively and generally prefers critical thinking and evidence rationalism and empiricism over established doctrine or faith feedism i don't know how to pronounce that okay so um i like these two things i am personally a humanist i um nihilism is a poison that is poisoning society as much as we don't think it is it is still prevalent um okay so uh let's see what is a simple definition of objective morality objective morality is a system of morality that is independent of human opinions or feelings okay as opposed to see what it says subject immorality is a system morality that is based on human opinion and our feelings okay i guess so um let's see uh from a cosmic perspective is life special interesting if even a tiny fraction of those stars have planets and that support life then there must be billions of planets with life in the universe what if earth is the only planet with life ah no i did not ask you to do that let's see in that case life would still not be special from a cosmic perspective the universe is so vast and old that even if earth is the only planet with life it is a tiny speck in the grand scheme of things okay i mean i guess that's a that's a nihilistic perspective um let's see um if life is unique to earth and life is the only thing um actually no here let me there's another question i need to ask first does life give meaning without life there can be no philosophy no meaning is this statement true or false why the statement is true life gives meaning to existence okay so so without life [Music] everything is meaningless pointless yes without life everything is meaningless okay therefore we can um [Music] can we therefore accept it as axiomatic that life is intrinsically valuable yes we can accept dot dot dot it's processing that life is intrinsically valuable because without it everything is meaningless does this run contrary to nihilism no it does not nihilism is the belief that life is meaningless and that there is no inherent value in anything uh but it just said that life is intrinsically valuable okay so the in this case i will say that uh that this is gpt3 failing at verbal reasoning um it's not perfect let's run it again this statement simply reaffirms that belief okay i disagree i think it is um okay let me rephrase it because so here's here's one thing where like if you and i were having a conversation and we can link those ideas um gpt3 sometimes seems to you know lose the plot okay if we accept that life is intrinsically valuable because it gives everything meaning then does this run contrary to nihilism okay but if this is like self-referential nihilism is the belief that life is ultimately meaningless however this does not mean that life cannot give meaning to existence in the meantime but if okay i think this is self-referential in non nonsense but whatever um gpt3 was trained on a lot of internet and there's a lot of edgy boys out there who who believe in nihilism so i think this is wrong but we can accept that life is intrinsically valuable because without it everything is meaningless um okay uh let's see um let me pause this for a second okay i know where to proceed let's see so without it everything is meaningless pointless okay what other axioms can we derive from this idea that life is intrinsically valuable uh let's see all life is valuable all living things have a purpose all life is interconnected and all life is sacred okay sacred is a pretty powerful word okay please expound upon these four assertions um let's see all life is valuable this means that all life is worthy of respect and care all life has inherent worth and dignity all living things have a purpose this means that everything that lives has a reason for existing all life is a part of a greater whole and has a role to play in the universe all life is interconnected this means that all life is connected to each other and to the rest of the universe we are all part of one big family all life is sacred this means that all life is holy and should be treated with reverence and respect okay this is really interesting i don't i think this is um this is kind of getting a little hand wavy so let me um let's see write a uh rigorous philosophical defense of the above assertions there we go okay so this shows that like you have to be really careful with your wording with gpt3 okay rigorous philosophical defense all life is valuable this assertion is based on the idea that life is intrinsically valuable without life everything is meaningless therefore all life is valuable because it gives meaning to existence there we go okay so that's referring back to itself correctly all living things have a purpose this assertion is based on the idea that all life is valuable since all life is valuable all living things must have a purpose this purpose may be different for each individual thing but all living things have a reason for existing yeah it's a little bit weak all life is interconnected all life is valuable since all life is valuable it is interconnected that's a non-sequitur um okay so i don't think i don't think it succeeded in defending this this point um let's see rigorous philosophical attack of the above assertions oh look at this this is great all life is valuable this assertion conflates the value of life with the value the value of life with the value of individual lives it is possible to be to value life without valuing all individual lives and vice versa i really like that all living things have a purpose this assertion is teleological and thus presupposes a purpose for existence it is not clear what this purpose is or why all living things would have the same purpose all life is interconnected this assertion is based on a notion of the intrinsic value of life however it is not clear how all life is intrinsically valuable or why this would lead to the conclusion that all life is interconnected all life is sacred this assertion is based on the idea that life is intrinsically valuable however it is not clear why life is intrinsically valuable or why it would lead to the conclusion that all life is sacred so it does rightly point out that um that there are some non-sequiturs here however we did establish earlier that um life gives meaning to existence so okay um let's clear this out and start over what is an axiom an axiom is a statement that is accepted as true without the need for proof okay what are some common axiomatic statements things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another okay a whole is greater than the sum of its parts interesting um let's see is life meaningless why or why not construct a rigorous philosophical argument there are a few different ways to approach this question one one could argue that life is meaningless because it ultimately ends in death okay however one could also argue that life is meaningful because it is a unique experience that should be cherished ultimately the answer to this question depends on how one defines meaningful if one believes that meaning comes from leading a life with a purpose then it is possible to argue that life is meaningless however if one believes that meaning comes from enjoying and savoring the experience of life then it is possible to argue that life is meaningful okay interesting let's see actually let's keep that for a second what are some philosophical frameworks that deal with this problem existentialism is one philosophical framework that deals with the question of the meaning of life existentialists believe that humans must create their own meaning in life as there is no inherent meaning in the universe this can be seen as a positive or negative view of life depending on how one looks at it another philosophical framework that deals with the question of the meaning of life is nihilism nihilists believe that life is ultimately meaningless as there are no inherent purposes to existence there is no inherent purpose to existence what if there is a purpose we are just not aware of it if there is a purpose to life that we are not aware of then it is possible to argue that life is meaningful even if we do not know what that purpose is the fact that there is one could give our lives meaning okay so we you know nihilism makes the assumption that there is no purpose when maybe we just don't know what the purpose is um okay so what are the problems with nihilism nihilism is the belief that nothing has inherent meaning or value this perspective can be problematic because it can lead to a sense of hopelessness and despair additionally nihilism can be used to justify harmful and destructive behaviors as there is no inherent value in anything see the russian nihilists what did the russian nihilists attempt to do the russian nihilists were a group of young people in the late 19th century who rejected the traditional values of their society they believed that nothing had any inherent meaning or value and they advocated for social and political change the nihilists were also known for their rebellious and often violent behavior okay so let's delete that that's fine um what are the benefits of nihilism nihilism is the belief that nothing has in any inherent meaning or value this perspective can be beneficial because it can lead to a sense of detachment from the world and a focus on the present moment can so that's optimistic nihilism additionally nihilism can be used to challenge traditional beliefs and systems as there is no inherent value in anything right so you challenge the status quo you build something new um however uh let's see how has nihilism infiltrated society today what um what evidence is there that nihilism exists in the zeitgeist nihilism has infiltrated society in many ways for example some people believe that life is meaningless and there is no point trying to make anything better you see this especially with some politicians who are just trying to maximize their own profit and destroy the environment additionally some people use nihilism to justify harmful and destructive behaviors okay it's getting really repetitive so let's clear this out the only way to handle uh repetitiveness is to clear it out um also let me take a quick check how long this has gone on because i can do this all day okay we're only at 15 minutes i think that's fine um let's see where should we go from here um [Music] what are the types of nihilism in society today including existential nihilism the belief that life is meaningless spiritual nihilism the belief that there is no god or other higher power moral nihilism the belief that morality does not exist political nihilism the belief that government and politics are pointless and corrupt cultural nihilism is the belief that culture is meaningless and without value yes this does contain sensitive content okay so just compact that a little bit okay um provide examples for each of the above let's say specific examples no that's not specific um here let's see provide a specific example of existential nihilism from the news or pop culture okay so let's see this is definitely sensitive content a story about a person who has lost all hope and meaning in their life and is considering suicide an example of existential nihilism from pop culture would be a character in a movie or tv show who is going through a midlife crisis or is questioning the point of everything um okay it didn't provide a specific concrete example but i'm sure you can think of plenty of examples of people facing nihilism okay provide a specific example of spiritual nihilism in society today the rise of atheism okay many people are now openly declaring that they do not believe in god and this is having a major impact on society churches are losing members and religious leaders are struggling to find ways to appeal to the growing number of atheists so that's interesting right um yeah i mean i guess that's true spiritual nihilism is on the rise however i will also point out that neo-paganism is also on the rise so maybe we are returning to super traditional values when when jordan peterson said we should return to traditional values he was probably referring to christian values but what if we go back to older values sorry i'll get off my soapbox oops provide a specific example of political nihilism today okay i was hoping it would be very very specific um anyways i think that's good enough for now you get the point you can you can talk philosophy with gpt3 it knows more about philosophy than i do i don't always agree with it but that could be from my own ignorance anyways thanks for watching
