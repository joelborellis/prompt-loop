hey everybody David Shapiro here with episode two of the AI startup crash course video series episode 2 is called experiment experiment experiment so as usual I will start off this video with a book recommendation uh crossing the Chasm by Jeff Moore or Jeffrey Moore I don't know which he prefers to go by um I have mentioned several times that product Market fit is uh your new god um read this book uh it is relevant to experimentation but we will also take a deeper dive into product Market fit uh and a couple more videos so uh yeah this graphic learn it Master it understand it and it will save your life experiment with everything uh when I say everything I mean everything uh get it get in the crash test dummy mindset that's why I picked this picture okay so what are some things that I mean when I say experiment with everything uh start by experimenting with teams and meetings try different teams try different startups try different groups of Founders try different uh methods whether it's consulting or building software or joining a team talk to people ask what works experiment with everything nothing is sacred that is the mentality that you need the crash test dummy mindset and nothing is sacred so for instance when my startup just got going we we had to experiment with meeting formats and so like we tried one meeting format and uh the most critical thing was to ask for pluses and Deltas at the end of every meeting what's going well so that we can keep it and what needs to change pluses and Deltas pluses and Deltas change change change change experiment and so after uh it was probably three or four different iterations we settled on a meeting format that worked and then Army meetings kept getting longer and longer because we had more and more to talk about and so he said okay let's try something else new let's split it into two meetings so we'll have one meeting at one point focus on one thing and another meeting and another point to focus on another thing so yeah experiment with everything people teams meetings nothing is sacred keep trying keep experimenting step two it's not an experiment if you don't measure something measure everything measure time money effort customer response use a b testing if you don't know what that is look it up figure out the Telemetry and kpi that you need what is a kpi key performance indicator an example of kpi could be user engagement time on site money spent conversion rate all that sort of stuff Metrology is an an entire discipline in in and of itself um yeah you got to measure you gotta have you got to check results and you will find through experimentation what gets the most results now that being said you might be measuring the wrong things that's why I say Metrology is an entire discipline unto itself social media you're watching my YouTube channel because I found the proper social media fit for me YouTube is my is it worked for me now there's all kinds of other social media presents if you want to establish a pla a platform and build a presence you'll need to experiment with formats the format of my YouTube channel that you're watching now is not how it started I experimented with content with video formats and and and everything and the the kpi that I that I cared most about was subscriber growth uh view count and hours watched um so those are what I optimized for and it worked and now my channel is taking off exponentially um so you do that you'll establish a presence you'll attract the attention that you need for your AI startup so that you can hire the right people so that you can attract the right investment and so that you can get customers right so those are the three things that you're trying to attract with social media you have a really powerful tool to go viral there is someone out there searching for what you are building and what you are offering and doing a social media presence platform is the way to get them UI ux if you're not familiar with these terms UI means user interface so how the website is laid out how your app is is laid out and ux is user experience these are both highly specialized disciplines especially user experience um do remember use a b testing find out why your your users like something and why they don't ask them say what is frustrating about this what's bad about it what is what you know what kind of experience are you looking for one thing that you'll learn is that users don't necessarily know what they need or want but their behavior is the best signal their behavior will change when you hit that sweet spot for UI and ux um products markets and avenues things change chat GPT came out and completely derailed one of one of the entire uh uh product lines that I was working on and I said dang so you know what try something else um different approaches different markets um if there's something that is not being served by you know a competing product or or existing service don't compete with the big guys find another way find something that isn't being served so look at look take a new approach look at it through a new angle look at it through a new lens uh and finally a second book recommendation is the Lean Startup by Eric Reese um there is some good information in here I'm definitely glad I read it um however what I will say is it has gotten some criticism which I understand I have my own criticisms I'm not going to get lost in the weeds in that um but it does have some good ideas uh and but what I also what I will say is as someone who's been in technology for 15 years especially in the I.T and software space a lot of this is already baked into the industry um so as as a as a technology Insider I get it however if you don't have 15 years of it or software experience you need to read this because you do not understand the tech industry um so that is primarily who it's for is if you're new to technology if you're new to um to Ai and stuff you'll definitely need this so that you get oriented to the tech industry and to Tech startups specifically but again take it with a grain of salt my recommendation is never read just one book my personal rule of thumb is whenever I'm trying to learn something I buy at least two books from two very different authors so that I get I look at the same problem from two different completely different angles so there you have it that is episode two of the AI startup crash course experiment experiment experiment thanks for watching
