come on all right are we recording hello yes okay hey everybody David Shapiro here it's been a hot minute since I've talked to everyone um I've been super busy on some top secret projects um news of those will be forthcoming if you're new to my channel which I imagine many of you are judging by the uh rate of subscribers and uh the trends so my name is David Shapiro I am a independent AI researcher focusing on large language models and cognitive architecture I have written three books on the topic my first one was natural language cognitive architecture a prototype AGI my second one was benevolent by design six words to safeguard Humanity which is about the control problem how do you prevent it from murdering everybody I got this problem solved um and then finally Symphony of thought orchestrating artificial cognition um so in these books I talked about how to use you know prompt engineering with Foundation models and instruct training models I also talked a little bit about fine tuning fine tuning is why you're here chat GPT is a fine-tuned model um it is basically fine-tuned to be a chat agent now here's the thing you go and use it and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna show you because if you're here you've probably played with it um it's the most popular thing you've seen right now um it's basically a wall of text generator um you you ask it a question it doesn't ask you any questions it's not actually conversation it's just stream of you know I'm gonna answer you um if you just go to Google News um or any any news search uh you know GPT or chat GPT is dumber than you think it recreates racial racial profiling it but it could disrupt the business of search it's not going to disrupt search and let me tell you why it's way too expensive Google has been doing search for decades and you know you search for anything on Google and you get two and a half Million results in like .006 seconds right GPT is like literally billions of times more expensive than Google search um so yeah good luck with that uh uh yeah um even and Google's integrating other deep deep neural networks into their search they're already using Bert for search which is why Google searches gotten better lately and it'll often just provide you the answer so yeah that's not happening um the reason that it still can do racial profiling and it's been banned um from like coding forums because like what was the quotation it was like you know it the code that it produces looks plausible but it's spectacularly bad um so really all that they have done as far as I can tell is come up with a UI this is this is a user experience or a user interface advancement um you know the future of Education like look I was fine-tuning chat models for for tutors and creative writing coaches and all kinds of stuff earlier I took all that down because it's you know part of my secret projects um so a lot of a lot of my best work is not available online anymore um much to the Chagrin of of some people um now that all that being said yes I am super critical of what chat GPT means the reason I'm making this video is because I want to be an expert voice that's going to give you kind of a balanced opinion so what's good about gptj or gptj that's the Open Source One chat GPT I apologize if I keep saying the wrong one chat GPT it's still new on my tongue it's weird um chat GPT um so what what's good about it one the interface is really really super intuitive that is the primary benefit here there was a post on LinkedIn I think it was a repost from TechCrunch or something that's that showed and this was actually re-shared by Adam Goldberg of open AI That's how I saw it I followed him on LinkedIn um excuse me I'm a little stuffy um so anyways what it said was chat GPT shows that user interface is just as important if not more important than the underlying model which I agree uh obviously you know large language models are out there I keep saying gptj on accident Neo X Bloom you know large language models are going to be uh become very commonplace here soon um so then the question is okay what do you wrap it in so here's a metaphor that I give um it's like having the engine of a Ferrari without having the Ferrari right if you've got a 500 horsepower motor or a 1000 horsepower motor but you don't have the right you know structure steering traction control it doesn't matter right and that's what chat GPT proves chat GPT is starting to put the sports car frame oops sorry let me mute my phone it's starting to put the sports car frame around the powerful engine large language models are Ultra powerful engines yes but you need to figure out how to steer it that's what chat GPT does now chat GPT is open-ended right it's I will just respond but it doesn't have any goals right so if you have a goal if you have an agenda as a person it's there to help you which is fine but that's not gonna that that still relies on you kind of steering the conversation but what if you need help with something that you don't know how to do you can ask it sure and it'll you know give you a wall of text about how to do that thing kind of in general vague terms but one thing is it doesn't ask you questions it doesn't care about you it doesn't you know and I I say care and kind of not even a platonic sense but in a functional sense it doesn't ask you questions because um it wasn't trained to it it doesn't have part of its Model A desire to you know figure out what you what you're actually after right um so that's that's a I'll say that's an oversight in their fine-tuning methodology um that one's for free by the way uh no more freebies though so yeah so it's a viral chat bot is it the start of the AR Revolution no all the people that are in the space with me that we've been working on this stuff for a couple years this is just a flashy interface sorry to break it to you I know if you're if you're new this is like super exciting which yes like this is a breakout moment for the technology because public perception is just as important as the actual technology right because how do you get hype is you have to have something that is hype worthy and open AI didn't even realize it would be this hype worthy um so that's fine um I'm not going to click on some of these you know blah blah blah blah started the AI Revolution no um let's see is it the next big thing or another tool to spread information misinformation sorry um I don't think it's either um it's too well I don't need to get in too much into it um GPT is not politically neutral that's fine let's see so anyways what I was talking about was what does it do good what does it do bad um one thing that that is become very clear that they haven't figured out is confabulation it still makes stuff up it's not connected to something that is considered ground truth now here's the thing other people are working on that right So Meta AI Facebook AI they have their project called sphere which is basically like Wikipedia But for AI so it can look up facts there's also knowledge graphs and and Wiki data and all kinds of other things where you can have stores of quote ground truth which is just something to check yourself against um there's semantic search which allows you to quickly pull fax from databases encyclopedias dictionaries whatever uh but as far as I can tell chat GPT is just a single model and it's not actually connected to a more complex architecture it's just a rolling window where it reads the last couple messages and answers your following question this this is not a particularly sophisticated architecture if you read my book natural language cognitive architecture the one the first cognitive architecture I propose is orders of magnitude more complex than that and then I have even more complex models uh proposed in Symphony of thought um but it'll be a while before us the rest of the world catches up to that that's fine um yeah so chat GPT is having a Thomas Edison moment yeah a light bulb moment um anyways uh you know what is what is everyone wants to know like what is this going to do what is it going to change so there are a few things that you know just off the top of my head something like chat GPT could do again once the once the cost comes out once people see how expensive it is uh to run you might think twice and kind of go back to Google when it's free right so there here's the thing is product Market fit is is one thing if it's free great but like the same thing happened with Dolly too when it when Dolly 2 was free the quality was like okay it's good enough you know I'll use it if it's free but as soon as they started charging um I saw I stopped using Dolly to uh except for on rare cases right it's like yeah you know it costs about 15 cents per generation so you know I'll buy a few tokens every now and then to you know make a YouTube thumbnail or something but I'm not going to sit there and play with it similarly if you have to spend you know a couple pennies per per conversation with chat GPT it might be worth worth it to you to have a subscription but what happens often when you don't have product Market fit and I don't think that this actually is solving any real problem it's Nifty right it's a cool tool but but it's like okay well are you going to pay for it and how often are you going to use it right because when you're talking about something that's actually going to be disruptive it has to be either so compelling that you need it and when you need it you absolutely need it even if you only need it once so an example of this is Zillow how often are you buying a house you know I bought my house eight years ago and yeah I look at Zillow every now and then but you know I found this house on Zillow and uh so I needed it once in eight years right so high need low frequency um so that's one way you can get product Market fit is is when they when your customers need you they really need you the other thing you can do do is have high volume but low utility so social media is an example of that where you know you use addiction mechanisms to get people or attention engineering to get people to use tick tock and Twitter and stuff all day every day so they're using it all the time but they're getting low utility out of it um and then then so that's if you want to appeal to the mass Market another thing you can do is you can do B2B right you can say I'm going to build something that's going to be useful to other customers um honestly I don't see GPT or chat GPT as having I probably have been seeing gptj the whole time sorry chat GPT I don't see that as having a mass appeal because here's the thing we're all used to using Google all day every day right we know how to use it we're familiar with this tool its results are more reliable we know how to interpret the results too here's the thing is chatgpt at at its present format it doesn't tell you how reliable it is it doesn't cite it's sources it doesn't say click on this link to to prove that I know what I'm talking about right you can't open a whole bunch of tabs of chat GPT and investigate each one so in terms of high volume not there doesn't exist and then in terms of high value but low frequency I mean you know it honestly it basically like for some of the functions it's just kind of regurgitating you know Wikipedia articles now that being said like if you ask it a basic boilerplate question it'll give you an answer can it do work though can it do cognitive labor um without that'll actually save you time and energy I haven't seen any evidence that it actually saves you too much time and energy now I have seen some people do like creative writing with it okay you know but as a novelist myself like you know getting barfing out a first draft anyone can do that cleaning it up on the other hand that's hard I figured that out um I know how to do that with with AI but I don't know that chat GPT can be an editor it can probably tell you how to in you know some general principles on how to improve your writing but your the point there is you're having to put just as much uh cognitive effort and time into it so it's not really saving you any time or energy so I don't see any of all the use cases and stuff like yes it's neat are you going to pay for it I don't think anyone's going to pay for it really um and I might eat my hat but certainly in its current state I think it's more of a novelty now that being said on the B2B side could this be useful to companies possibly especially given the the way that it formats it its answers if it can give you really empirical like you know hey we're going to hook into your your your your your databases right your um your payroll and your um and your customer service databases and you know sure okay I don't know like there might be there might be some B2B use cases um but I don't see I don't really see b2c use cases especially not at the price point of these models they're just too darn expensive to run so it's like okay well what what would be the price point what is the kind of conversation that is so valuable that it would be worth it so what are the most what are the most expensive conversations you have one of those is going to be with your lawyer right or your doctor because how much do you pay them you pay them 400 an hour essentially to see them to talk to them so you know if your time is that valuable and you can do most of it via conversation I could see you know those really high value consultation kind of things and obviously there's there's plenty of other kinds of consultation other than medicine and law but of course those are also very highly specific things where you have to know really know what you're talking about and be licensed right you have to you have to you have to pass your boards if you want to be a doctor and you have to pass the bar if you want to be a lawyer chat GPT can't do either of those things so at best it could be an adjutant or a or an assistant right but again human brains are still faster in in many respects so it's like okay you know those are the high value ones are they going to do like a a legal eagle version of chaby chat GPT are they going to do you know a uh a doctor or whatever his name was a famous doctor back in the day um you know version of chat GPT uh you know I I don't know especially because a lot of then then especially if you do medicine that that's considered a medical device and that means you need FDA approval right so there are these there are these use cases um science is another one where science is expensive but we saw the recent debacle with meta Galactica right where they trained it on a bunch of papers and it's still they still didn't figure out confabulation it started making stuff up so I don't think they're going to find PR uh product Market fit uh with their current format um so novelty sure breakout sure um it you know it it's gonna follow the hype cycle everyone is going to see chat GPT and everyone's gonna Pile in we're going to have a whole bunch of newcomers a whole bunch more venture capitalist investment a whole lot of speculation we're gonna get above a bubble and then it's gonna you know settle back down as reality sets in and um and we'll kind of go back to business as usual now that being said I am not calling for an AI winter my uh my fiance uh called me out because about a year and a half ago I was like man you know I'm using GPT and I've got about all I can get out of it so I think we're heading for another AI winter uh boy was I wrong um so she reminded me of that very helpfully um so no we are there are many many high value cases that we are figuring out how to use GPT with and I've been talking to a lot of Industry veterans from all all over I won't call anyone out by name but people that were there for the.com Revolution and crash um people that were there for the mobile Revolution which is still ongoing right uh 3G 4G 5G right Veterans of the industry and they say they all say so here's here's the thing here's what the experts are saying people that have been in technology um longer than me they are saying that this feels like the mid 90s of the internet where everything is just getting started we are just figuring out the potential of what we've got and it's like we know that there's something there but we only have the first inkling we don't even have the tip of the iceberg like it's the the icebergs on the horizon we can see that there's something out there but we don't have any idea how big it is we just know that it's big um what was it there was something that someone told me just like many conversations I've had actually where it's just like something changed in the last few months it was about the last I think probably since August or September like it just like Spidey senses tingling um and then of course chat GPT comes along and and explodes the popularity so again you know I I'm not even tepid like I'm I'm full steam ahead on this but chat chat GPT is not going to be the thing that changes everything it's just you know uh caught the public curiosity ah I think that's about all I got
