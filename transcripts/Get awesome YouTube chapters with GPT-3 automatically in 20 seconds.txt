hey everybody david shapiro here with another video um today this was uh not what i expected to be working on but i saw someone on the open ai community ask about um doing youtube chapters or something or other and then someone posted it on the discord and i was like you know what it's time for me to do some seo so i created youtube chapter generator you're free to use it it's pretty straightforward so let me show you how to use it real quick so you go to one of your youtube videos you could probably do this via api but i haven't figured it out yet so you go to video details subtitles duplicate and edit then you do edit timings and then you do download subtitles so it downloads captions.sbv you go copy this file copy it over to the directory and then you just do python generate chapters and it will yeah it will go um go through and summarize each chunk it took a little bit of prompt engineering to do it so let me show you and then the final output is nice and pretty so it gives you a time stamp and then it summarizes that whole chunk so how did i do this well first the prompt um so i'll show you the prompt to just summarize summarize the entire following transcripts into a single descriptive title with timestamp and so descriptive title with timestamps so i just give it a chunk of the sbv and it gives you a timestamp and a job market so i've got a few shot prompt so i give it just two examples and then it handles it just fine it summarizes the whole thing gives it a good title so how did i do this so first you open the transcript and then you split on double new lines so let me show you why you split on the double new line so each chunk is conveniently separated by a double new line so we split it into a list of those items and so then i give it i take a chunk size of 20 so we'll take 20 of those transcripts and just generate a list of lists and so then we go through that list of lists which each chunk is going to be 20 items long or so and then we populate it into this prompt and then it goes from there and then it just joins it there at the end so then you have this and so then you just copy paste that it's the right format you come back into this you exit out discard changes details you come up to the top of your description copy paste and away you go and now you have automatic chapters and so to show you how fast it is um you just come back in here let this uh add finish real quick and then i'll show you and now you see i've got all my chapters sorry i'm talking over myself um into relatively equal chunks and then you see here where it's like the pentagon says china will not invade china uh taiwan in the next two years the fall of cryptocurrency mining and its impact on ai hardware these are really good titles i'm proud of this okay so anyways that's it for today just a quick video um on this cool tool that i made because i'm trying to optimize my own youtube channel so thanks for watching have a good one like and subscribe and support me on patreon
