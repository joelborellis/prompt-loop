good morning everybody this will probably be a short video today okay um so i got this idea from the uh from the open ai community where someone was asking for help doing reviews and imagine you've got you know thousands of reviews and you want to sift through them the old school way would be to do like bag of words vectorize cluster you know all sorts of stuff without actually ever looking at the reviews so what i did was i went out to kaggle and i found um you just search for like product review um and one of the first things that pops up is amazon product reviews 115 megabytes um i actually think that i got this one another thing place you can do is you go to datasetsearch.google.com it searches kaggle so like it's basically the same thing so you do uh you know product reviews um and hey look at that 34 000 reviews of amazon products um so there you have it it's it's i think this is the same file so i downloaded it and let me show you what it looks like um 300 or 260 megabytes of uh of reviews now these are a bunch of different products and you see it's you've got all kinds of stuff right so you got the you got the rating you've got um uh you've got urls a lot of this is irrelevant right the primary thing that i really want is the text the actual text of the review right because this is what people are saying um you know old school you could do you could you know aggregate numbers um you can look at you know which reviews are more popular but that's all math what we want is actual semantic meaning um so what i did was i cleaned this up so this uh this spreadsheet is you know very large very messy um so what i did was i deleted all the rows that i didn't care about um so i cut it down to just the product name the title and then the actual review text oops here let me and then the review text um because that's really all i care about is just what what is the product and then what it what did a human actually write because i don't really care about the number right people people give ratings somewhat arbitrarily um okay so that was that was where i started and then um so here's oh and one other thing is because the csv data i have no idea what the format was i had to come up to encoding convert it to ansi save it close it open it up and convert it to utf-8 because it would not play nice with python um so anyways here's what i did was um well here let me comment out some of the stuff um because i was experimenting without recording which i know i shouldn't do so let me just show you where we start so reviews list so this is just empty empty list and then we'll load reviews.csv encoding utf-8 as in file we'll we'll um we'll load it and then what i did was if if the row zero so that's the product name so that's what will appear here in this first part so fire tablet with alexa you know um and there's a whole bunch of different versions of the fire tablet but i wanted i wanted to get all of them together so it's like okay there's the the fire tablet for children there's the seven inch display there's the 32 right there are still fundamentally the same product so what i wanted to do was i wanted to get all those together and see what people think of the fire tablet um and so as if the row so we're we're we're reading the csv file so if the if r if element zero so that's the title if it contains fire and tablet and not charger because i realized some of the reviews were for just chargers and it's like okay well i don't care about a separate charger um then then that's that's what we want to look at so i just kind of opened the data filtered it all out so let me show you what this looks like let me increase the font size properties font 28 so you can see what i'm doing uh cd summarize and then we'll do python summarize reviews so this is real quick so i've got 14 000 reviews for fire tablets great am i going to read all those that's going to get real expensive if we do that no so one thing that happens when you um if you want a human to look at something you do what's called an audit so an audit is where you you you take a subset of of a hole and you say okay i'm going to look at a subset of these just kind of picked it random and see how well they match up and so what we're going to do is i'll show you i'll show you one pass so i import random seed so that that pre that that rotates the uh the random kernel um subset equals random choices and so basically what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna pick 25 reviews at random um and then here let's comment this out because we don't need it and then what i do is for those 25 random reviews i join them into a text block and then i'll show you the length of the text block so we'll just do this real quick so that you can see how many characters it is because the thing is is uh we have a limited amount of space in our prompt window so oops i gotta save it helps if you save it um so this is 360 or sorry 3600 characters uh let's run it again 11 000 characters so you see there's a little bit of variance there 11 000 should still fit that's actually the longest one i've seen usually it's around four to six thousand as the maximum um so yeah someone wrote a really long review um okay so you see it's typically in the in the 4000 range that's that's a perfectly reasonable number uh length of um of uh of of uh for a prompt input so then what we'll do is we'll open up a prompt and i wrote this real simple prompt i tested this online it works really well i'll show you an example um of of how well it works but is just write a detailed summary of the following product reviews what are the key features that people love and hate about this product and then you know you put in the reviews and then detailed summary so i usually put the instructions both before and after the information that i'm working on i found that this gives the most reliable results because sometimes especially depending on what's in here it might kind of confuse the model but if you if you sandwich it between the instructions it's like it goes in knowing this is what i'm supposed to do and then you remind it of its instructions at the end and it usually gives you pretty good results um okay so then we we load up the prompt we put in the text block we get the response and then we print the response so let's just show you let's make this a little bit bigger because i know you're watching on a a youtube video okay so we'll just run this it'll take just a second to run and then basically we'll be summarizing 25 reviews okay but you're like that's 25 reviews out of 14 000. so what do you do with that okay so strengths great price lightweight and portable screen is great expandable memory um it's durable weaknesses slow some apps not compatible parental controls could be better okay great that's that's really that's that's a good summary um so we took you know four thousand to eleven thousand characters and summarized it so then we run it again so this is what an audit is is you you you randomly select samples and then you'd kind of uh you you look at it multiple times so then you say okay people love the affordability versatility and ease of use of the fire tablet okay so we see affordability so that's repeated so that's consistent versatility so this is this is a little bit different maybe this is what they mean by you know lightweight and portable or expandable memory um and then ease of use right however some people found that the tablet is breakable so this is also in contrast with the the uh durability does not support connectivity to a 5g network so there's limitations so we're seeing that okay we don't have a full picture obviously like if you if you get just 25 reviews out of 14 000 you're not going to get the whole picture but you don't need to read all 14 000 reviews so what we're going to do is run this a couple more times and i'll show you that this is what you do in an audit you keep collecting samples until you see the pattern repeat key strengths of this product are its clear picture nice size screen and good price so we're seeing price price price price um key weaknesses are its average battery life and charging ports okay so run it again and so this will be four times key strengths are those great for kids it is very affordable and has lots of features key weaknesses is that the app store is a little limited and the micro usb portion gets loose so that's probably the charging port this could all the pattern is also emerging maybe the thing that breaks is the usb ports um okay so that's after just four iterations so what we're going to do now is we're going to automate the audit process and so what i'll do is i'll take this so we'll say let's see summaries equals list and then we'll say for i in range let's see we got to do list list range 0 um to 10. um actually that might give us 11. that's fine it doesn't matter um okay so we'll basically just repeat this so we'll say subset so we'll just grab a random subset out of those 14 000 reviews we'll grab 25 of them we'll we'll smoosh it into a block of text because you know gpt3 doesn't understand python lists but it does understand text then we'll feed it in and we'll get the response and then we'll say summaries dot append response okay but then what are we going to do okay we have all these responses together what's the big deal so let me tell you what the big deal is we will oh and actually let me add that so that way each each one has its own little dash at the beginning so then what we're going to do is we're going to take all those summaries and we're going to do it one last time because in the prompt we say detailed summary detail detailed we want we want to know all the details so we'll keep we'll use the same exact prompt and so this is like a meta-summary um and we'll say uh here we'll just copy copy some of the stuff that works text block equals join but instead of subset we're going to do we're going to join summaries and then we will do the same thing so we'll get one final meta summary at the very end and [Music] let's do we'll do a couple of dashes new line new line and then new line new line so that way it'll just kind of separate it all out okay so let's run this and basically what we'll see is we'll see it do 10 or 11 i can't remember the exact logic if it includes or excludes the last number i don't remember that's fine either way point being is we should get enough to see some patterns emerging um and then there's all kinds of other stuff we can do with these right we can change this prompt to uh you know to say like not just what they love and hate but just what are they saying about it um and then we can also ask we could ask gpt3 to infer recommended changes to the product right actually that's not a bad idea let's go ahead and do that so rather than have this prompt let's say um let's see given the following well here uh read the following review summaries of the product um these review summaries um uh let's see let's see these summaries capture a uh capture the over the general let's see the general sentiment of this product recommend um some possible changes to the product um some possible let's instead of changes let's say improvements because changes that doesn't specify which way so you got to be very careful um with your wording so some possible improvements to the product to make customers happier happier there we go okay so then we'll say recommended improvements to the product and then we'll just we'll tell it to start with a list and then we'll do prompt um improvements okay so then what we'll do is we'll come down here and instead of prompt.text we'll do prompt.improvements [Music] and so in this case we're basically automating you know just with a few steps we're going to we're going to we're going to audit the reviews of this product and then generate some actionable um oh what's the what's the term request from enhancement rfe um so we're going to basically generate an rfe um from just a little bit of data all right so let's see what oops let's see what happens um it might blow up i'm usually pretty good but i've got my handy dandy coffee alright key strengths are it's great for travel right size kids mode great for reading and netflix key weaknesses that has system lag poor wi-fi and dim screen let's see great for kids competitive does not have a lot of horsepower so it's weak though we keep getting that good for young children great value tablet affordability durable key weakness is that it is slow slow dim okay and then finally reduce system lag inqui increase wi-fi reception increase screen resolution make apps more user-friendly increase storage space and improve speakers so we've got some recommendations right off the bat and then it this is just a really quick summary now imagine you could do this recursively and this was only this was only um like 10 or 11 or 12 um queries to gpt three so this is actually a relatively cheap approach um let's run it again i'm gonna copy this out to a notepad document just for posterity sake so let's just copy this out so we can do a stair and compare when we run it again so let's let's run it again just to see if it comes up with similar recommendations and the thing is is like on the one hand i know that you know putting this in charts and diagrams and classifying each response like that is an old school way but like what we what we really need is the usable information what does a human want we don't need to translate it into numbers and then try and interpret charts we can actually listen to what humans want okay so make the tablet faster so performance that's popped up again make parental controls more user friendly that has popped up several times make the charger port more durable see i saw that pattern increased sensitivity of the touch screen improved quality of the camera so we are getting slightly different um different results that's fine but remember each of these chunks is is summarizing 250 reviews right um and there's also there's all kinds of of prompt um changes we can make so for instance for the original prompt we might say instead of uh write a detailed summary we can just say list right we could say list all the unique bits of feedback actually you know what let's try that this video is not that long it's only 17 minutes so yeah let's do some experimentation so one thing i noticed is that um i'm gonna remove this because this is this is bad for lists so we'll remove that that's fine um all right so let's do some prompt engineering so instead of writing a detailed summary let's do list all of the unique let's see what is it like unique recommendations or uh let's see points unique points that customers are making [Music] the customers say about this product we want to focus on um strengths weaknesses weaknesses and improvements okay so we're gonna we're basically we're going to ask for a list now so um so we'll say thorough list of all the keys strengths weaknesses and improvements for this product okay so we'll remove that we'll prime it with a list all right so let's just do this and then we'll just do one pass just to make sure that the output is what we expect so i'm going to go ahead and once it gets here i'll just do an exit zero so this is kind of just a quick debug poor man's debugging so i just wanted to do one pass and then show me the results so we'll do summarize reviews it'll grab 25 random reviews okay it's a great learning device for kids with a wide variety of educational programs inexpensive very durable slow cameras is poor wow okay great this looks really great um yeah um all right so let's let this go and we'll see yep recommended improvements for the product um so we'll we'll uh we'll just let it summarize that um i didn't say summarize yeah i said read the review of the summaries the summaries capture the general sentiment of the product um recommend some possible improvements the product to make customers happier perfect okay and then one thing that i noticed in the previous output is that they're all smushed together so when we do the print when we do print response we'll um we'll copy this so that there will be some vertical um some some space to break it up okay so let's see if we get even clearer results um summarize reviews all right let's see what happens and i'm going to drink some coffee perfect for kids super easy great parental controls tons of applications customers are generally very pleased lightweight user friendly fuse no it's going too fast no google play store great for kids great picture weaknesses kids mode not as good as expected so by asking it to enumerate things rather than summarize or i think we're actually getting more detail and so by getting more detail we're going to actually see patterns emerge more quickly and then did it freeze it fell asleep oh it generated a really long response okay so faster load times better speakers more control over the screen and keyboard and google play store so every time we run this we get slightly different slightly different feedback um i wonder if recommended improvements to the product so here we said thorough list of all key strengths and weaknesses let's do thorough am i spelling thorough right that doesn't look right okay i did spell it right [Laughter] um thorough list of recommended improvements to the product um so there we go so if you if you use those adjectives thorough list right because we notice if we go back in here sometimes um it didn't necessarily it generally followed the list but not always um and so by saying thorough list we're using an adjective so that's a modifier it's not just a short list right because we look at the we look at each of these where it gave us like a whole bunch of great points and then in the final one it just gave us four recommendations it's like that's not enough for me like i can't send that to a product team i need to i need to automatically send a report to a product team that is going to um that is going to like make a difference that's going to give them a little bit more to work with yeah so in the in the final one this would actually be like a user story if you wanted to integrate this into agile you'd actually take these insights and generate a user story be like as a parent with children i need more control over parental controls that do x y and z because my children you know downloaded and spent five thousand dollars on my credit card something like that you you would need a little bit more detail if you wanted to send this to a product team um but we're just doing product or prompt engineering also if you want to contact me i do consult so if you have this idea this need and you want help consulting and making this into a commercial application let me know okay so some of these are really stupid on fire great buy processor is slow yeah great kindle on fire great buy like i don't like this very slow less cumbersome awesome product yeah so we're getting a lot of irrelevant details um i think it might be um i might need to do a little bit more prompt engineering okay make the tablet more user-friendly make the tablet faster and more responsive improve the quality of the apps include a user's guide interesting make charging port more durable see that's one that we keep we keep seeing make the tablet more stable okay so we're starting to see some patterns emerge um i think that i might have messed up this this original prompt because it i wanted a thorough list of all key strengths weaknesses and improvements um and i did also say list all the unique points that customers say about this product um so let's see summarize the following product reviews um as a list of these strengths weaknesses and improvements um that might be better um so then we'll just say we'll just say list of all key strengths weaknesses improvements for this product um i'm getting lost in the weeds i'm just doing a little bit of prompt engineering we're getting a little bit closer to having the pattern that we want to see also one thing that you can do in the long run is if you get enough of these runs where you get the kind of formatted output that you want especially if um if what you're looking for is um is an actual rfe which will follow a very specific format or if it's not an rfe because rfes are for products a request for enhancement or a feature request you might need a user story which is for software so those you'll want to do fine tuning and maybe i'll do another video of those later about how to automatically generate um rfes and um and user stories yeah i'll call it there today i think you get the idea that there's a lot of potential for automatic um uh data data handling um so thanks for watching consider joining my discord community um uh there will be a link in the comments as well as consider supporting me on patreon if you like what i do um let me know and uh and i can do more of it thank you
