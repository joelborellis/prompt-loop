morning everybody David Shapiro here with another video um sorry I missed yesterday I was feeling rather tired um I woke up after only four hours of sleep and uh and yeah I've been really focused on some of my projects make sure am I still centered okay yes centered all right so we've got a busy day today since I missed yesterday so this will probably be my only video of the day first up we've got um Nvidia Jetson Oren so for those who are not familiar um they're Jetson series is uh is small mobile Edge AI so I have a Jetson Nano which is like 10 times less powerful than this guy so let me just let's go ahead and just dive in I'll show you on the learn more tab so they've got the the board level um a little bit of a diagram of what what all is included on the board um but like taking a step back like what is what do you use this thing for this is a developer board for prototyping mobile applications or portable portable applications um and so you see here uh you got some like or I guess like another example like what can it do um you can do video inference you can control robots that sort of stuff but yeah okay so you've got um 512 core Nvidia ampere or 1024 core okay sure but how does that compare to previous generations so here you go I have a Jetson Nano um which you know okay sure um I think I spent like 400 on it um but look at this guy you go from um from a performance factor of seven to 134. so that is more than an order of magnitude that's two orders of magnet or almost two orders of magnitude um better performance um yeah so that's 20 times 20 times a performance um almost um yeah uh and you see that kind of increase across the board pretty much um so you go from uh for LPR um which my brain is not supplying what that means right off the moment um from 47 to 534 for dash cam 11 to 198 for body pose from 3 to 68. um so yeah you get these and this is just the the introductory version yeah and obviously you get you know twice the performance if you have a a um core that's twice as dense um yeah so these are these are Next Level they are more expensive um so for instance the full developer kit let's see where was it I think they're like two grand um let's go to Jetson aurum learn more autonomous machines it's pretty though look at that small form factor getting started guide that's the comparison where is the pricing I know I looked at it huh okay well I'll post it in the links if I can find it anyways the uh just the raw oh here's some prices yeah um so Jetson AJ Xavier yep so all the different prices are here um yeah so this is interesting if someone wants to send me one I'd love to play with it but usually I'm more on the high-end stuff portable portable mobile and Edge AI is a is a whole different domain okay so next up from Nvidia we've got uh Nemo their llm service so what is Nemo um the Nemo homepage sorry let me go back up to the top um Nvidia Nemo is an open source framework for developers to build and train state-of-the-art conversational models so this is this is um end to end this has voice and language models um this is this is kind of their Flagship it's based on Megatron the 530 billion parameter language model so this is four ish times bigger than than gpt3 and Bloom I have no idea how well it's going to perform but there there you have it and so they've actually opened up um you can apply for Early Access which of course I have as a researcher who studies alignment cognitive architecture and now I'm focusing also on uh on uh generating long form fiction I obviously want access to this they require an NDA for granting access so even if I do get access I probably won't be able to talk about it we'll see what the NDA says and that's of course if I get access but it's very exciting because this is a huge model um and it's it's going to be powered by Nvidia which is you know other than uh cerebrus wafer scale engine the best on the market for running AI um yeah so that's also very exciting um we'll move on from there uh another thing speaking of large language models is pedals so someone on my Discord helpfully uh shared this so what is petals it is exactly what it says right here it's a decentralized platform for running 100 billion parameter uh language models so if you remember seti at home or folding at home this was a case where you'd have an agent running on your machine and you would receive workloads from the cloud or from you know distributed peer-to-peer Network your machine would do would work on part of the workload and then send the results back this is similar but instead of running like you know a little folding experiment or processing some Radio Data what you're going to be doing is actually processing um one or two layers of a large language model and you will be a node and a network so you'll basically break apart a large language model into many many nodes to run across many machines and then you'll receive just a part of that layer and then you'll pass those results back um so they say that uh it's it's still pretty fast and so on I've got the paper pulled up so uh let's see there was a good graphic that kind of shows it um well so first here you see like they've got a little distributed Network um but yeah so here's here's a very simple example I love how the gpus have uh have little little googly eyes um so basically you have multiple clients all contributing workload uh demand and so then there's different people with gpus hosted all over and so then they get um you you'd get you contribute your GPU so you're running workloads for other people and other people are running uh workloads for you and so it's a peer-to-peer network of gpus basically so uh structurally I don't know if it's actually similar to the way that folding at home or study at home was done I'm just pointing out that this has been done before it's been done for decades um literally I I had a folding at home set up on uh on my laptop when I worked at uh more than 10 years ago and of course distributed computing has been around for a long time um but so this is just the next logical development of that um so good good little graphic there I like pictures um let's see and they talk about the performance and and all the methods so what what I think is most interesting is uh they they talk about like what are the incentives right so um the if you if you contribute so when when there was folding at home and study at home really the only incentive was you got to be on the leaderboard right you know it was publicly stated how much you know how many packets you had processed or whatever but in the era of cryptocurrency you could actually earn provable work right like the proof of work is work that you're actually doing for the world um and so you get points or tokens or something and we'll get to this in a minute um and so then you can spend those tokens for whatever um they're just speculating that this is something that you could do but say for instance you get process tokens or um those entitle you to something else um you know you could exchange it for money you could exchange it for processor time something like that security so when you have a distributed system there is going to be um there is going to need to be uh lots of uh awareness of potentially malicious actors so you're probably going to have to have gatekeeping and reputation management on on these networks you might have private networks so you know kind of what happened with um with Torrance is that you ended up with with private peer-to-peer torrents um you might end up with you know PODS of of security of trusted things and they actually talk about that here with privacy as well um so a key limitation of our approach is that peers serving the first layers of the model can use their inputs to recover input tokens thus clients working with sensitive data should only use servers hosted by trusted institutions that are allowed to process this data so again security and privacy it's kind of it might be answered by the same thing where you have private fleets or federations of distributed gpus from making changes to the main model um so like if you if you adopt a New Foundation model but basically what petals allows you to do is is both do inference um I think they also allow training but inference and fine-tuning um for large language models which is currently um an intractable problem for uh individuals to do just because it's so expensive um so yeah this is a really great um really great thing and you see that there's it's kind of a global team you've got some Asian names some Eastern European names um yeah so this is this is definitely the way of the future and speaking of distribution ahead folks from towel reach out to me and I've had lots of people telling me that I should look into Tau for a while so what is Tau Tau is a type of of Dao decentralized autonomous organization so what is a dow a dow is a decentralized autonomous organization it is a way of creating and managing any kind of organization of people whether it is a for-profit company an academic institution or even a government um and basically what it uses is it uses the public Ledger technology of blockchain in order to register everyone's ownership votes controls that sort of thing um so it is a system of governance um and I know if if you as a watcher are still skeptical of the power of blockchain for this keep in mind that Australia recently moved their um their public Stock Exchange over to a blockchain technology um and there's plenty of other uh companies and Nations all over the world experimenting with both private Ledger and public ledger blockchain so remember that blockchain is not intrinsically public Ledger that's just the Bitcoin implementation was a public Ledger you can have a private blockchain that is not distributed across um or that is publicly visible anyways so with the Dow a distributed autonomous organization that would be a private Ledger or could be set up as a private Ledger anyways I don't want to get too bogged down in talking about what a dow is um but uh the the the foundation team the leadership team these are legit folks um all uh phds or otherwise um well-established folks with doctorates and professorships and so on so what is the point of this um tau is one experiment among many but one of the things that they're doing is they are working on distributed inference as well but they have the economy part so here they talk about incentives so Tau actually is working on that with their their agaris um cryptocurrency so one of the one of the goals and this is very aspirational though is to create something that could replace or augment democracies so with democracy today it is very old-fashioned in that you have a straight up and down vote you basically vote for or against a person or an initiative there's no discussion so what one thing that that a lot of us on my Discord server and Tau and in other places what a lot of people are talking about is working towards more of a consensus model and I've talked about consensus before so consensus is different from democracy in that it is a process of negotiation and discussion and development of new ideas the scientific Community works on consensus right you publish a paper people chew on it they discuss it they disagree with it they write responses it's peer-reviewed um and so over time uh the scientific process is very slow and that is by Design and consensus is also slow and it's by Design but it is participatory um everyone gets a say and then of course someone's reputation um dictates or it influences how much their say impacts things so there's a novel that a friend of mine recommended called liquid rain that explores this in part it basically says a guy guy goes into a coma today and wakes up in the year like I think it was 2054 and so it's basically an exploration of how the world might be different in three decades and one of the key features of that novel is that um is that one it's post-scarcity and so just by existing you have an account that is constantly accumulating cryptocurrencies from all over the world and it's all paid for by basically syntax um uh or or what was it Indulgence tax I think is what it was called um anyways sorry got an itchy spot on my back um and uh but but also so every transaction is a crypt is a public Ledger cryptocurrency transaction in this world um which means that if you buy something that is that is bad for the environment or bad for your health you pay additional tax on it and that tax is immediately distributed to everyone else in the world with no middleman um so that is one possible implementation of a dowel but then you need a currency built in with that also the political system in this novel liquid Reign is that it is 100 distributed in that as long as you are a person on that Network so you're you're gaining currency but you also have votes that you can delegate to other people and you can vote on issues and that is exactly what the Tau system I actually wonder if liquid rain was inspired by this paper anyways the Tau system allows you to participate in all discussions and contribute to all issues and then over time for every individual issue or topic you build consensus and then you can also depending on how you have voted and all of your contributions you can integrate that with artificial intelligence and you can have an agent that will automatically vote for you or automatically eventually automatically propose things for you and so what you're basically doing is creating a a distributed network of generative adversarial networks that are all negotiating with each other on the behalf of people in order to come up with the best decisions that affect everyone such as things about like um you know law making environment uh you know public policy social policy that sort of thing um again super aspirational but uh these folks have reached out to me and I was I've got about halfway through their white paper um there's a few things that seem a little bit vague and hand wavy but having explored this idea through the through the lens of of that work of fiction that I told you about um and also looking at other things such as you know the D the decentralization of um of artificial intelligence I think that these folks are really on to something I don't know if they're going to be the ones to crack it but certainly we're at a phase where everyone is working towards this direction um so yeah I definitely recommend you check out petals and towel I'll be talking with the folks from Tao a little bit later so um we'll see if uh see what comes of that um and then finally open AI is they uh they posted on Twitter and again folks from Discord hopefully uh pointed this out um sure yes okay um they are working on creating basically a new version of of system of experts or an expert system so if you're not familiar um what the the idea was in the 80s that AI would be solved by having experts program all the rules and laws of their domain of expertise into a symbolic engine and that didn't go anywhere it didn't work uh because what they found was that there was Always Something There are there were exceptions and nuances that you just could not hard code with formal logic so openai is revisiting this idea because now we don't have to use formal logic we can use language models and so what they want is they want experts in biology chemistry computer science economics engineering law et cetera Etc and they want to design they want these people what it looks like to me is to design fine-tuning data sets of of asking the right questions and generating the right answers to those questions I don't know if this is going to work I don't think I personally don't think that a a handcrafted fine-tuning data set is the correct approach um personally I think that um that that doing a more generative adversarial Network where you have kind of a peer review process um is going to be far superior but maybe they're doing this just to just to bootstrap it who knows it's kind of a black box open AI as uh is they do produce very good work but they're very cagey until they reduce they produce that work um so who knows maybe they're trying to bootstrap a system of experts or an ensemble of experts in order to have a kind of an automated peer review system um someone actually yesterday alone I think two or three different people messaged me directly about having um having different models or different fine-tuned models like basically debate or contribute in order to do something better so there is a again this is also a decentralized idea which that's the theme of the day right is is decentralized um and so we'll see if that works I apologize if I've been all over the place I hope that uh I hope that you've gotten some value out of this um but yeah so this is a very exciting time I miss one day and all this exciting stuff happens so teach me for taking a day off anyways thanks for watching um sit tight stay tuned and we'll talk again soon
