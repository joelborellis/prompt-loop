morning everybody David Shapiro here a quick update um I put it I put out a call for uh people to interview because I want to uh revamp this Channel and kind of focus on not just my ideas but I want to talk to people and I've had the privilege of talking to some really great people I've got a handful of of interviews some podcasts lined up so stay on the lookout for those but in the meantime what I wanted to do was kind of uh as as 2022 winds down boy was this another year you know it wasn't quite as much of a dumpster fire as 2020 and 2021 um but it was a year and I wanted to end on a slightly more optimistic note I am uh forever optimistic my fiance says when I talk about the future I get Singularity sparkles in my eyes like an anime character so I wanted to share that with you So today we're going to talk about Singularity Sparkles uh and and why I am super optimistic for 2023 I'm not even talking about the distant future I'm talking about the next 12 months so let's let's Dive Right In so first um there was the just a couple days ago um news about net energy gain from um from what was it the Lawrence Livermore lab um in uh in in America in the U.S so we have theoretically hit a one of the biggest milestones in Fusion research which is the amount of energy that it takes to you know heat up hydrogen or helium and smush it together and get Fusion that for the last 70 years has taken more energy to get ignition than you get out of it so why there's a whole bunch of reasons I don't want to unpack it there's plenty of other great YouTube channels that go into details um veritasium uh Sabin hasenfelder like all kinds of people have great videos on that but what I want to say is this is huge um I think that this is just a leak I don't know if it has been confirmed yet but if it's true if we have had net gain then whatever they did is this is going to set investment on fire so the reason that I'm excited about this I've been studying markets and economics on the side lately so what this means is there's already a lot of investment in Fusion this is going to turn that up to 11. and the reason is because in the mind of investors and speculators they're like oh well if the Americans just figured out this critical step that means it's possible right because until now Fusion is always 20 years into the future right it's always something that is hypothetically possible but this says that it is physically possible that it has been demonstrated that you can get more energy out of fusion than you put in so this is this represents a saltatory Leap Forward saying okay this is no longer this is no longer theoretical this is no longer hypothetical it is actual it is concrete you can get more energy out of it so now it's just a matter of making it commercially viable so I I expect that by this time next year we are going to see an explosion in not literal explosion metaphorical explosion in investment infusion and hopefully um more people around the world will get will get first light you know first ignition um which the reason that Fusion is so important is because um Fusion represents one uh safe energy but two also clean energy but also hyperabundance of energy so the sun is our we we already have a fusion reactor in the sky right and we can we can use it by growing plants we can use it by collecting solar we can we can harness Tides right and waves and stuff greater that's a gravity engine but anyways point being is Fusion is already the most reliable power source to this planet but if we can do it in a smaller scale locally then you can do it all the time um it's difficult to say what what Fusion would unlock because then problems like carbon not a problem uh growing food not a problem salt water desalination not a problem if you have a hyperabundance of of thermal energy there's pretty much nothing you can't do right like you can you can even well it would take a different kind of physics to like break the speed of light so I'm not going to comment on that but at least in terms of industrial things that we do right anything mechanical or industrial suddenly becomes the marginal cost becomes basically zero um and what I mean by marginal cost is the the cost of you know making a ton of concrete when you have a hyperabundance of of energy from Fusion the cost of making a ton of concrete is near zero the cost of cultivating an acre of land is near zero right and so then Fusion is probably one of the biggest technologies that will help us to get to a post-scarcity or hyperabundance economy which oh boy you think people can't agree on economics now just wait till that happens okay so that's number one Fusion in 2023 keep your eyes on this space it's gonna get wild um all right now Fusion might still be 5 10 20 years from being commercial right we hit we like within this week we had a huge breakthrough um but in the meantime we're still going to need other kinds of energy right because um you know between between uh Global geopolitical uh things you know Russia China everyone else who's not getting along fossil fuels are going to be you know they're they're already unpopular right because of climate change but solar and wind in particular are becoming so cheap so quickly and this actually reminds me I forgot to add Battery Technology um there's more more news coming out about better batteries and cheaper batteries anyways um Renewables are accelerating so people people don't believe me when I say this I have a friend actually who who um started their graduate program in this space and before they started their graduate program they were so angry about climate change you know every time the ipcc report came out they're like you know the world is ending we're in trouble and I'm like no we're not no we're not like it's it's going to be fine like this problem is solved um but it needs to be deployed right when I say the problem is solved I don't mean that climate change is is gone I mean that from a technology standpoint from a scientific standpoint we have the capacity to become carbon neutral or carbon negative now it's just a matter of deployment so that's why you see things like tax incentives um and carbon credits because the idea is um under neoliberal theory is you incentivize the behavior you want to see so and you use Financial incentives so you create incentives to do the for the market to do the things that you want so it's like okay for every you know ton of carbon you Offset you get credits for every kilowatt of solar you deploy you get credits whatever so anyways that is working and we are seeing this accelerate because you know you might remember in the last you know in 2015 they said oh it's going to be 2045 before we can even offset coal because coal is so cheap and so easy and so efficient but the thing is is um the the market has responded right and so all the biggest all the biggest uh tech companies GE Honeywell um I can't remember but those are two of the biggest ones that just like they churn out like you know they know how to mass produce stuff and so it's like hey we need to mass produce this let's do it let's get on it and so that drives down the cost of solar panels and um and uh and and wind farms but then also there's other things like um it takes a while for banks to catch on right like because you see like a solar farm like this this takes investment right and and like most energy generation there's an upfront investment um but what is different about solar is that it's entirely up front with very low operating costs because there's no mechanical parts right and when you have when everything is solid state and you have no mechanical Parts the maintenance is very low all you pretty much all you have to do is replace these solar panels as they burn out because they do there's a mean time to failure of about I think what like 10 years or something so that means after you know by by the time that 10 years has passed you'll have replaced about half the panels you have to keep them cleaned every now and then you know bad wiring or bad components you know you might have a bad inverter but there's no fuel input right so with most PO with with most energy generation there's a fuel input which is an ongoing operating cost so you know you have to with with coal or gas or oil you have to have trains and tankers constantly delivering fuel but with solar the fuel is you know a billion miles away in the sun um we're just collecting you know like there's no reason that you couldn't do this with a fusion reactor where you just line the a big enough Reactor with solar panels I mean there's lots of physics reasons why that wouldn't work because the proximity right if you put something too close to a fusion reaction it gets burned up um but anyways my point is is that this is very clean and the fuel is a long ways away and it's also functionally infinite so anyways um point being is you know people are thinking about like oh when are we going to break even on carbon people aren't thinking about what happens when we have 10 times more energy than we do today available to us through Renewables right with Renewables alone can get us to a state of hyper abundance maybe not quite you know 100x like Fusion could but we can get to 5x we can get to 10x and I suspect that this number is going to continue to go down because this time last year this number was like 2032. so in the space of a year we've lowered the threshold by another two five seven years I don't remember exactly but the point is is that this number of break even and replacement is has gone down every year faster than a rate of one year per year so 2023 might be the might be the last year that we use more fossil fuels than Renewables that's a bold claim but in even if it's not true we're going to be closer and that's a good thing right um I need more coffee as you can tell I'm this this stuff is very exciting to me um we are we are we are living through the most interesting time in the human species since like the invention of fire and wheels right like it's it's difficult to say what's going to happen from these kinds of things okay so that's energy let's talk about um Computing so the rest of this video is going to be talking about different kinds of computing such as Quantum Computing photonics and AI obviously that's where I got my start that's my main Jam is AI so obviously there is a global like I don't want to say arms race because it's not a weapon or at least I guess it's it could be weaponized but everyone is is working on Quantum Computing um all over Europe America and China are all competing for Quantum Supremacy IBM I think excuse me has the best chance of doing it um so from from a tech industry perspective IBM pivoted started pivoting about what was it eight years ago or so when they started selling off their commodity Hardware so they sold they sold a ThinkPad off to Lenovo they're like this is this is commodity we don't we don't want to focus on this anymore they pivoted to Watson Watson didn't work out because um they didn't have uh the Deep learning benefits that that we do today so they're they're they're they're spinning down Watson as far as I know or pivoting it I don't know but anyways IBM is is going all in that they're they're looking to the Horizon and they're saying Quantum Computing is the next big thing in Computing and so what they're going to do is they're focusing on that and they have they have the money and the expertise to to do it so I think that Quantum Computing you know 2023 obviously uh it may or may not be like commercially viable by then um but I think that we're gonna see some really good advancements on Quantum Computing in in 2023 we'll we'll have a better idea as to who's close to who's closer to succeeding um again my money's on IBM um time will tell so that's uh that's one thing now the question is like okay so what like what does Quantum Computing do that other things can't and part of that is we have to actually figure it out because the field of of quantum Computing and Quantum algorithms is still being explored and it's difficult to explore until you have the machine to do it right similar to like uh some of the some of the original mathematicians who predicted what computers could do had to do it all with pencil and paper and there's only so much that you can do to predict what you know what uses of a machine you can have like you know when when we got to punch cards and stuff um and and then compilers uh it's it's not in it's not immediately obvious what you can do with a computational engine when it is still hypothetical or theoretical like Quantum Computing is um so right off the top you know Material Science um AI modeling like one of the things that I thought was really cool that that some people predict Quantum Computing could do is where you give it a whole bunch of data and it just magically like magically pops out the AI model you know it it fits all the parameters for your your neural network like with basically no training time um because it it superposition and everything settles into the lowest energy states on and so forth um you could do the same thing with materials right and we'll get we'll be we'll get back to the the power of AI and materials in a minute but um in general I think that I think that modeling really complex systems like economics Material Science that sort of thing and cryptography are probably going to be the first things but I also suspect that that because Quantum Computing is kind of specialized in the same way that like gpus are specialized if we can ever get Quantum Computing down onto a single chip operating at room temperature it will probably be a companionship like you have a GPU and a TPU sitting alongside your CPU right and then you'll have a qpu a Quantum processing unit so I suspect and this is this is way more than like five or ten years right this is this is like 10 to 20 to maybe 50 years into the future once Quantum Computing is miniaturized and then it serves as a co-processor that accelerates you know other kinds of processing anyways keep an eye on this space I think that I think that you're going to see it see the space heating up a little bit I don't think we're going to have any solitary breakthroughs just yet um yeah uh but I could be wrong you know um but I think it'll I think you'll see some acceleration in 2023 on Quantum Computing now the surprise entrance so that there with with acceleration and exponential growth it's impossible to really predict so it could be wrong one thing that I have seen a lot more news on over the last six weeks is photonic Computing this is light-based um information transfer and Computing and the fact that I see this space accelerating suddenly we might be close to assaultatory breakthrough in photonic Computing which this would basically gut Moore's Law and the reason is because um it has to do with like the thermodynamics of it but basically the short version is photonic Computing has the potential to be a hundred or a thousand times more energy efficient than um electron based Computing um so if this happens then you have like okay what if you have photonic neural networks right what if you have photonic transistors that operate in instead of in the gigahertz range they operate in the terahertz range right what if you suddenly have processors that are a thousand times faster and a thousand times less energy that means that our Computing is going to be nearly as efficient as our brains so our brains best estimates right now operate on about our our exascale computers right the the amount of computation that our brain does three pounds of of uh neurons is about uh you know one exaflop of processing power by comparison the current exit exascale computers that we have consume about 20 megawatts of power you compare that to the 20 watts of power that our brain uses and our brains are literally a million times as efficient as the most powerful computers today well if silicon or if um if photonic Computing is a thousand times more efficient than silicon then that means that that it's still it's still a thousand times uh more energy intensive than our brains but that's a thousand X rather than a million x right so these kinds of breakthroughs again it's really difficult to to predict what's going to happen because suddenly if this happens then it you know let's let's say let's let's assume that the cost is commensurate right so you know your GPU today if you switch that to a photonic GPU suddenly you have 8K Graphics running at a thousand frames per second and you know eight quadrillion uh vertices or a um uh planes what is it texels I don't remember the term for graphics anyways you're going to have Graphics that are sharper than your vision right if if you if you have a photonic you know graphics card um another thing that that could happen is all the large language models that we're using today that cost millions of dollars to train instead of millions of dollars to train they cost thousands of dollars to train and then instead of instead of um you know costing pennies to run per minute they cost you know a thousandth of a penny per minute to run they become trivial right um if the cost of AI becomes trivial even what we have today if you lower the cost of running it by a factor of 10 or 100 or a thousand excuse me a little stuffy um then business is not going to be able to adopt AI fast enough it's going to be run as fast as you can Implement as much as you can because the marginal cost of this stuff is is near zero again marginal cost and then imagine if the power cost also reaches near zero because of Renewables infusion so this is where you get those compounding returns between energy and computation because then you have more AI that is able to better to make to model Fusion better you have better AI that's better that's that's able to help you design better batteries right better uh solar panels better medicine and you get these compounding returns particularly between computation um specifically Ai and deep learning and energy where you get this positive feedback loop and then it just away it goes until you hit some kind of point of diminishing return so I want to touch on that real quick is you know yes it looks like we're accelerating exponentially right now but the question is are we going to follow a um a hyperbolic curve where it just accelerates to Infinity are we going to take a parabolic curve or are we going to follow a sigmoid curve personally I talked to a lot of scientists friends and they see that once once a space is fully like explored research slows down um so there are that we should expect to see diminishing returns this is always true pretty much everything follows diminishing returns it's just a matter of where on that sigmoid growth curve are we at have we passed that midpoint where the acceleration is going to start decelerating in a lot of these spaces particularly AI fusion and um and and Computing I think we're still on the ramp up so I think that in these spaces we're going to continue accelerating um and that and that will have bleed over effects to um things like medicine genetics and Material Science which again it's it's darn near impossible to predict the knock-on effects um from all these especially once they start working together right um so that's that's it on on on on that aspect so a few other things in the AI space this is what I mean by when you when you mix things right so an experimental crisper technique has um you know cured this 13 year old of cancer I am seeing more and more articles like this where some AI driven um biotech solution has done something that thought was thought impossible another one um like cured or prevented pancreatic cancer right and so particularly so the net effect is like okay so what does it do for me right do I care about Quantum Computing or AI or deep learning you know if you're if you're a ordinary Joe or Jane you might not care because it's not going to affect you the difference is the difference is what if suddenly we have an mRNA vaccine that prevents all cancer that is within the realm of possibility or in this case you know a a therapy I think that this one um yeah it was um uh it was genetically edited immune cells right so what if by the end of 2023 we are starting to see cancer vaccines or other Rejuvenation therapies you know um kind of stem cell therapies or immune therapies that basically cure everything there is um so along the same lines of this there's an mRNA vaccine being worked on in New Zealand I think that cures um like prevents all high cholesterol with an mRNA vaccine who would have who would have predicted that so that's what I mean by some of these advancements you can't predict what's going to be solved by it so all we can do is guess but the pattern that I'm seeing is the combination of crispr AI and mRNA vaccines I think that we will basically solve maybe not by the end of 2023 but not long after we're going to solve pretty much all disease whether it's cancer autologous diseases like high cholesterol um or or Aging in general we might have a lot of progress towards basically preventing all forms of death by the end of 2023 I think that um and again the uh when you when you look at the market right Market forces say hey there is so much money on the table here if you are the first one across the finish line and you can patent um a pill or an injection that cures these things you have the next billion dollar pharmaceutical company right um so the race is on uh to get these things done and this is where AI like Alpha fold we'll get to that in just a second actually let's go ahead and do that um so here's another example oh this is whoops this is the one that I was talking about um pancreatic cancer so um you know using AI to model these things excuse me same story so let's just let's just move on because it's like I'm gonna be in danger of repeating myself Alpha fold I think uh Alpha fold is going to be um remembered as one of the most important Innovations and so this is where it's like okay yes it's deep learning it's AI books but so what right Alpha fold three when that comes out and it's you know cheaper more efficient and can model interactions and shapes and other stuff whatever whatever happens um we're going to see we're gonna this this is the technology that actually allows for personalized genetic medicine because then you take um you take your genome you say okay let's let's simulate your particular proteins and we can figure out which of your proteins are misfolding or are not present enough and we can fix that we can teach your body to make that protein or give you the right stem cells to make that protein or to fix that protein and this I mean again the number of things that this unlocks like we might have a therapy to prevent Alzheimer's right because Alzheimer's is a protein problem where you have plaques that accumulate because they're not cleaned up properly okay we can probably fix that um same thing with pretty much all heart disease all cancer uh you know and gosh I mean well you know you talk to a microbiologist and like pretty much all disease comes down to uh misfolding proteins um or or you know designing proteins that do particular things and that includes immunology and um and allergies right food intolerances what if you have Crohn's disease or IBS and and um you know leaky gut syndrome or whatever and it's like oh we just need to give your uh give your intestines what is it epithelial cells like epithelial cells that can that can produce the right enzyme to digest that so then suddenly you don't have any chronic inflammatory issues right um again these are all things that that I see are within the realm of possibility I would not be surprised if we see more and more announcements like this um in 2023 all right so finally I've talked a lot about about you know VC and investment because here's the thing you always always always see like scientists you know have unlocked this potential and then nothing comes of it why it's so frustrating right where you know in theory something is is scientifically proven um to work or demonstrated the difference is from Theory to commercial application it has to be financially viable and it also has to pass muster for a lot of regulatory bodies like the FDA um so the reason that I'm bringing up this is because chat GPT super popular this is like this is like a watershed moment for people to invest in AI remember in my last video if you watched it about it was just about GPT chat GPT um was that it's it kind of proves that it's possible Right it brings it front and center and so then what you have is you have a lot of fomo fear of missing out and so then everyone and their brother who has any money is like hey you know Facebook is going the way of the dinosaurs even Google might be in trouble um so they're pulling their money out of those Tech Giants and they're going to be looking for startups right they're going to be looking to the Horizon saying okay who's doing good stuff with AI and so this was uh particularly this year was a watershed moment and so what we're going to see in 2023 is the next that we're basically seeing the beginning of the next.com Revolution this is the AI Revolution where everyone and their brother is going to be doing AI startups um and there's going to be billions and billions of dollars going around you're going to see spectacular collapses you're going to see mergers and Acquisitions um the big players are gonna are gonna vacuum them up right you know Google Microsoft IBM um and and others um probably Honeywell GE all of the big tech companies Raytheon they're going to be they're going to be buying up AI companies startups left and right and in the meantime um there all the speculation is going to be out there again you might be thinking so what what has this change for me well one thing that it might change for you is um the the thing that's going to be impacted the most is uh is the nature of work so you know a lot of folks myself included have have long said AI is going to you know destroy all jobs um and there there is a rising um there is a rising like uh chorus calling for like a four day work week or a three-day work week one of the reasons that that will happen is is because worker output like economic output has continued to increase while labor input has either flattened or tapered off actually in some Industries this is going to accelerate that so what happens when the productivity per hour of labor on average aggregate like goes up 10x from what it is today how much are we actually going to need to be working that's that's a non-trivial question but then you all there's other questions like okay how do you ensure that everyone gets what they need um you know do you do some kind of redistribution or credit system or whatever do you redistribute the labor that's one of the reasons that that some economists are calling for shorter work weeks is hey let's just cut everyone's week in half and then you have twice as many people that you hire right so that you redistribute the work um rather than redistribute the capital I don't know if that's going to work um or that I don't think that's a complete solution I think that because some people are just going to be pushed out of the the labor market entirely and chat GPT proves that I don't have the article brought up but there was one that said uh chat GPT past the bar right it passed it passed a practice test for the bar so if chat GPT is smart enough to pass the bar exam which is how you become a lawyer what else is it smart enough to do is it smart enough to be a doctor is it smart enough to take my job my day job as an I.T technologist possibly so then if you have this technology that is infinitely cheaper to run even as expensive as it is to run it is infinitely cheaper than human labor right the marginal cost of of AI versus human labor is like it's a million times cheaper to run right because you can get an expert opinion from AI granted there's still problems with confabulation which I'll show you I'll end it I'll end this on that problem because as optimistic as I am there are still some very large problems to overcome with this technology before it's ready for the for game time right before it's ready for to take Center Stage there are some problems to overcome however the potential is there okay so what is that potential if you have if you can do high value intellectual human labor with a machine that costs a few pennies to run per minute whereas you know the the the cost of a doctor is you know about 10 or 20 dollars per minute that's how much their time is worth let's see because if if someone charges let's say 600 an hour that's ten dollars a minute of is how much their time is worth so that's that's a that's a specialist lawyer or actually that's an average lawyer and like a specialist doctor right or or um or a experienced physician so let's just say that that expert human labor is about 600 an hour but this can this can can perform the same number of tasks One faster um because these things spit out text real fast um and then it only takes a few cents so then you're looking at something that is like sixty thousand times cheaper than than the human expert um again marginal cost of medicine could drop to near zero can you imagine what if your medical bills per year is like ten dollars then it's like okay it's practically free right what if what if your legal bills or your financial like you know getting your taxes done and and your CPA what if all that is you know cost ten dollars a year maximum um it again it's really difficult to see what's going to happen and then the question is okay people see that value and and so you know if if that's if that's the cost of providing that service and there's multiple people offering that service I know I can hear some of you this is what I stopped I was like my mental model of the audience was like oh yeah but if there's if there's that much value to be bought to be gained someone's gonna squeeze right someone's gonna say I'm gonna jack up the price the difference is um all of the open source people making sure that access to this technology is democratized so you've got Nvidia you've got Microsoft you've got Google you've got a Luther right you've got hugging face you've got all kinds of players both for-profit and not-for-profit you've got open source players all competing to make sure that this stuff is is accessible to everyone and that is going to really really push down the cost of these models and these services and again remember earlier all the leaps forward that we're going to see in Computing means that even these big expensive models are going to be 10 times cheaper to train 100 times cheaper to run and this is in the next year or two right so we're going to see this exponential early growth of or I guess exponential decrease in cost right um exponential decay in terms of marginal cost to run and train these things which means everyone's going to be able to access it like my my my three-year-old GPU is big enough to run stable diffusion right and so people are going to refine these models get them more efficient more cheap and that means everyone's going to be able to run it every startup every company even people at home are going to be able to run these models and it is impossible to say what that's going to do to not just the economy but your day-to-day life because again imagine that you get to you know age 50 60 70 and you know they take they take a sample of blood run your run your uh genome and say okay you need you know this this and this mRNA vaccine we're going to cure your your Alzheimer's we're going to cure your high blood pressure your cholesterol um and also your um your um uh what is it the brittle Bones the um I can't remember the word right now anyways like that is within the realm of possibility and I'm not saying like that like that that personalized medicine 10 years maximum 20 30 maximum probably 20 27 if I had to guess right now just the way that things are accelerating at an exponential rate again is it going to be exponential forever or are we going to get diminishing our turns we will get diminishing returns but especially in the field of energy and AI we are not anywhere near the top especially when you get the compounding returns from advances in Computing okay I'm repeating myself lastly I had someone ask me to comment on this the build of building a virtual machine inside chat gbt so this is where yes it's really cool but there are problems to solve so the the problem is confabulation making stuff up when you have the ability to be infinitely creative it is a double-edged sword because you need to be creative to solve problems like cancer like climate change however if you are creative without constraints so that's that's the that's the key thing is uh so I guess a way of understanding confabulation it is creativity without any constraints then you just kind of Go off into La La Land and and it's a dream world and so that's what this person did where he said I want you to act as a Linux terminal so this machine hopefully says okay I am now a Linux terminal and everything you see from here is pretend it's not actually a virtual machine it just understands the behavior of the virtual machine well enough to be able to emulate that that behavior to pretend right which is a really great capacity right I don't want to say that this is bad this is good the fact that it is capable of doing this um that it understands things this well um is and can pretend that means that it's got a very good mental model like an internal model of the world of machines so this this what this means is this model chat GPT understands technology well enough to pretend and if you have enough if you have enough um familiarity with something to uh emulate it to simulate it that means you have enough uh ability to reproduce it and to anticipate what it's going to do right so again like this is like it's a double-edged sword because this level of capacity can be um it can it can be it can be dangerous because how is it doing that right you know it's a black box I mean human brains are black boxes too and we have ways of testing humans to make sure that you know that we know what's going on um but without without the right constraints or guard rails um it basically what I'm saying is we need to spend a lot of time testing this and ensuring that um that we give at those constraints and guardrails so that it is connected to reality right now this is all just hallucinating disconnected from reality right it's not embodied it's not interacting with us except through a very very narrow pipe right of bits and bytes we're not giving these models cameras microphones robotic chassis they don't have a ground truth reality to interact with yet they're they're only getting the data that we're giving them and then so it's like imagine a brain in a jar right it's dark there's only one way in one way out and it's through a line of Morse code that's basically how these models exist right now so they have no idea what is going on in the outside world in the real world and that's what I mean by constraints you and I our brains are finely calibrated to interact with the real world through our bodies right your brain in a jar I mean that's all it is it goes out through your brain stem and and a few other nerves and so it has input and output and the physical world is our primary constraint right and the feedback that we get through our bodies and that is how we one our brains learn to like identify what is real and solid and factual to the best of its ability obviously like you can argue you know until the cows come home about what a fact is or what the truth is but the fact of the matter is our brains do good enough to be functional right now these models are not connected to physical reality to our physical reality we can we can change that by giving them simulated realities which again that'll get easier as computation gets cheaper and energy gets cheaper um we can give them simulated realities like plug it into the Unreal Engine um you could also do text-based simulation I've tried that which is pretty pretty interesting um but then you can also put it in robotic chassis and then it can you know kind of go through a pedagogical you know learning phase where it can you know uh kind of experiment with what is it that I'm capable of and learn via feedback loops right now though it's kind of in la la land what direction are we going to go I don't know there's there's infinite number of directions we can go from here um and basically all I'm saying is once you've got something that is this intelligent it's going to take a while to to put the right wrapper around it in order to make sure that it is stable and reliable because if it's capable of imagining that it's a virtual machine right now um then like okay uh how do you know that this is these are real results right that's that's kind of that's kind of the point is like this is a very very vivid imagination it's not connected to reality and so that's why it's a double-edged sword good imagination not grounded in reality yet I think that's kind of the the core assertion that I'm making here anyways all that being said is um everything that I showed today this time last year would have been a pipe dream this no one would have believed you 12 months ago you showed someone this they said they would say BS not possible that's 10 years away minimum 15 years away probably so if we are at the knee of the curve and we're accelerating who knows where we'll be at this time next year in terms of AI I think that I think that I think that AGI we'll still be debating about what AGI means but I think that we will agree that 2023 in the future looking back 2023 is the year of AGI then it's only a matter of how fast it is how cheap it is to run because right now it's going to be prohibitively expensive to run and train um but it's gonna the question is not going to be whether or not we have AGI but how fast it is how cheap it is and how um like what age level it's at right because some of these capacities are already above like 10 year old reasoning right you know 10 year old human so you know it's going to be like okay you can do anything you know equal to like a 15 year old or 20 year old or 30 year old right and then we're going to need entirely different measurements like IQ that's probably not a good measurement of measuring how intelligent AGI is that's part of the problem is we don't have a good way of measuring it anyways I'm rambling now so I'll call it a day but yeah this is this is my recap of of uh where we're at right now at the end of 2022 and extrapolating and anticipating we're are going to be at in the next 12 months thanks for watching
