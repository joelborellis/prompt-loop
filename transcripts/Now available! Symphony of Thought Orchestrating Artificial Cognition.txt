morning everybody david shapiro here with a quick video just an announcement before i head into my day job um yeah so symphony of thought is available electronically i've got it up on github it is available in docx epub and pdf i'm particularly proud of the cover um yeah so about this book why would you want to read it with the advent of large language models we now have machines that can use verbal reasoning planning all kinds of stuff i know uh some people are rather skeptical about the intellectual capabilities of large language models um and to them i just say uh spend more time playing with it um and also check out my books but yeah so basically what uh what i realized is that large language models can do pretty much anything as long as it can fit inside of a page or two so that means we can have we can do brainstorming we can do planning we can look at cause and effect there's all kinds of things that that large language models can do however their window size is limited and so what that means is that you have to plumb everything together with some kind of architecture and so i've been experimenting with this stuff for a couple years now um specifically gpt3 i've been doing other experiments um for much longer um and yeah so here's here's kind of the contents of this book um in part one i outline the problem um so basically i look at you know technological trends um the size of the brain exponential growth of machine intelligence and then we talk about machine autonomy so basically my assertion is that one way or another we are going to end up with autonomous machines before too long and those autonomous machines are going to need to think for themselves and that is the core purpose of this book is to talk about creating autonomous thought in machines and i make the case for modeling ethics and morality and i talk about how difficult it is and so basically the conclusion there is it's too difficult to come up with a single moral framework so instead we need a thinking machine that can address all moral problems um it's not about having a single objective function it's not about having you know it's not a matter of choosing deontological ethics or teleological ethics it's a matter of creating a machine that can do all of it um and then i also talk about the zeitgeist and talk about like okay what's going on in society today that shapes our current thought and and what are what are some of the drivers of what we're doing and again the conclusion here is um it's too complex to create a single moral framework therefore the framework we need to create is the thinking machine so that's the whole point of part one is why is it that we need a thinking machine why is it that we need an independent autonomous thought then in part two i talk about kind of the high level components of um of a thinking machine and so one thing that i need to clarify up front is that this is not meant to be a blueprint this is more about about the principles of creating a thinking machine kind of what are some of the components and paradigms and methods that you can use to create thinking machines and so for instance i talk about you know the architectural components what i call the nexus a conductor loops microservices that sort of thing and then i talk about uh principled ideation so the core of thinking is come is is generating thoughts and so i call this principled ideation um where i talk about my heuristic imperatives which is like okay what is what is the what is the heart of your thinking machine if it's sitting there in a vacuum if it's isolated in a jar what is it going to be thinking about and why um and then there are four um criteria that i established as to okay what is it that we're looking for when we create this principled ideation and the first criteria is universal applicability we need to create a system that is universally um uh uh valid um and that's no small task it needs to be flexible and adaptable again because we're we're looking at all the different paradigms all the different uh philosophies and ethics and and intellectual dispositions it is obvious that you need something that is flexible and adaptable and then third it needs to be robust the whole point of creating these machines is that that they are creating machines in this way is that they're they're going to be safe right um we don't want to accidentally exterminate ourselves or anyone else we want to um sorry let me mute my phone real quick um it was supposed to be muted um sorry about that um yeah so it needs to be robust um the stakes could not be higher because if we get this wrong and you know we go extinct that we get one shot at that um and then fourth it needs to be implementable one point of frustration that i have is that some folks just want to debate endlessly without actually any consideration to what is actually possible with code and machines and you know because like some folks say like oh we'll just teach it ethics okay how um or you know just just make it a buddhist machine okay how like you can't you can't just kind of speculate you have to actually have the rubber meet the roads uh rubber meet the road and like actually get code out there code and data so then after after kind of setting the stage about um here let me zoom out a little bit after setting the stage with kind of the high level overview of of what it takes to orchestrate artificial cognition um part three is about thinking ahead so this is like you know assessing a scenario um recalling past events um embedding an agent model which is an agent model is a sense of self so an agent model is required for um sentience you have to know what you are and what you're capable of you predict outcomes and you discern um you discern like the best path um and then you plan and and address setbacks so that's part three which is kind of thinking ahead or preparing to act part four is cognitive control so cognitive control is more colloquially known as like a sense of discipline right if you are a disciplined person you will one you'll make good decisions but two you'll be able to stay on task and you'll be able to task switch um appropriately um and so there are things some components of cognitive control such as keeping track of topics changing priorities um self-awareness and metacognition also figure into it and also if you notice that it shifts from left to right it's because this pdf is for printing um anyways just notice like you might notice that the alignment changes and that's because this is this is the actual printed copy um yeah and so then also for cognitive control you need to be aware of like your identity you need to be um you need to be conscious of your beliefs and what evidence you're operating on so there's a lot that goes into cognitive control and then part five learning so this is actually the shortest section because and there's a reason that it's at the end is because this is where the most work still needs to be done but i still have a few principles to start with which is first record everything um and then two label your memories to create uh curated automatically curated data sets and then what that goes towards is self-correction and error detection so you know machine learning that's pretty well established no you you ingest data you know especially if you have a robot with cameras and eyes having data is not going to be the problem labeling that data and curating data sets to train new models that's the problem but more importantly if you have an autonomous autonomous machine it's going to need to self-correct and detect errors both in itself and outside of itself and so yeah that is uh that is an overview of the book um the reason i'm just i'm gonna i'm going ahead and releasing it as um electronically is because looking at the numbers most people just download it electronically all of my other books i've only sold a handful of like physical copies the paperback will be available soon but like 99 of people just read it digitally so there you go it's out there um symphony of thought uh on my github um you can probably just search for it um but yeah symphony of thought orchestrating artificial cognition out now um stay tuned for the paperback thanks for watching
