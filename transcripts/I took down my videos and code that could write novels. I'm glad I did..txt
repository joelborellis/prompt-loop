hey everybody David Shapiro here um I just saw on Twitter that uh the hashtag support human artists was trending and it really resonated with me um you know there's this there's this this thing you know uh no AI art AI art is theft if you search for AI art you get a whole bunch of similar things and this brought up something very personal for me so I still get a lot of requests from on LinkedIn Twitter Discord wherever of people asking me to put up my code and videos that precipitated my original Auto Muse projects and I've taken them down and they're staying down and I wanted to use this as an opportunity to explain why when I got to a point where I realized that I could automatically generate entire novels I realized that I would hurt my friends um I realized that I that I could hurt people that I really care about um that being said I'm not going to single-handedly stop this tidal wave right you know you look at you look at websites like Lexica and AI art is here to stay generative AI is here to stay the genie is out of the bottle even though a lot of it's really weird some of it is really good um and it really begs the question what is art you know some say beauty is in the eye of the beholder some say that art is human expression you know um I'm a big fan of of both death of the author but also death of the audience does the author matter does the audience matter because sometimes like for instance my own novel I might never publish my own novel and the reason is because I don't necessarily need an audience I'm writing something for myself that being said I have a lot of privilege because I don't rely on my writing I don't rely on my art um in order to you know make ends meet um and so it really kind of you know there's there's a philosophical question right like I said what is art does it require an audience yes or no um but then there's the economic question of livelihood and you know AI is you know the there is there's a great post on Reddit sorry let me mute my phone there's a great post on Reddit that said um you know if a year ago or a year a year and a half ago someone would have told you that that art was going to be the first thing that AI you know disrupted they would have said that you were a lunatic right um and so now everyone is like okay well if they can come after art they can come after everything right and then there was that post that showed that GPT uh chat GPT was capable of passing the bar exam right so maybe no one is safe from AI um and you know again I know that I'm not going to single-handedly stop this uh but I also don't have to participate in something that I that I know could hurt people um now where do we strike the balance right because here's the thing is is electronic music real you know I I can imagine that there was probably a time you know when people said oh you know records that's not real music radio that's not real music you actually need to go witness it being produced live by another human um or in CGI for filmmaking right there's this popular quote of um of Ian McKellen having um you know beginning emotional on the set of The Hobbit because it was all green screen there was there was it was a lot more CGI a lot more green screen and a lot less on site um and and practical effects uh for The Hobbit versus Lord of the Rings and he said he reportedly said something along the lines of this is not how it's done right um but at the same time like you can't put the genie back in the bottle right electronic music is here to stay deep learning is here to stay you know it's kind of like you got to learn to live with it and it's because it's it's impossible to put it back now we as individual consumers can make choices right we might choose to only go to websites that respect human artists you know whereas and it's kind of dividing right because I think Deviant Art they're like let's go all in like there's just a whole new category of AI art whereas art station is like bands it outright so we're going in different directions and that's generally what happens historically speaking you generally get like it's not like either or things split right and another example is with the invention of the automobile right the invention the automobile put all the stable hands out of business right all the people who cared intended for horses even the number of horses in the world went down after the invention of automobiles right so like not only did we put horses out of the out of a job we had less demand for that species as a whole and now there are fewer horses are they extinct no we still keep horses um we go to you know the conduct the Kentucky Derby we watch them race some people and horses some people ride horses for fun you know there's they're still Trail horses so whenever technology advances and dislocates something that we're used to it doesn't I don't want to say never it usually doesn't go away completely there are some things that are fully eradicated but there's nothing that's like AI art just makes art much more accessible and I think about people like myself that I just do not have the right skill set and so like I'm not going to bring it up but I started making like a Manga version of my novel which is something that would have been completely out of reach for me as an individual so that I can tell this story in a visual way for myself now is that fair to the artists like you know I I paid an artist a graphic artist like what was it like 700 um in order to make just just a cover art for my novel right and it's it's it's weird because it's like okay I could spend like 15 cents or you know a couple dollars using out painting to get something pretty close and then I could probably you know use uh some more AI tools to clean it up and make it you know a little a little nicer so it's like okay it cost me like two dollars or seven hundred dollars right from an economic perspective it makes sense because AI art increases the amount of production of Art and you know we humans have a nearly unlimited appetite for art um anyways I'm kind of in danger of repeating myself but you know I just I just wanted to to share like I took down my my code and and uh my videos around um generating novels generating fiction and they're gonna stay down for that reason that being said I am still working on lots of tools but the tools that I'm working on are specific to helping human writers right like there's editors that I like the editor that I hired I spent Seventeen hundred dollars getting my novel edited by a human and this is while I have the capacity to make AI tools to edit it for me right so I still chose to go with a human um because there are there are still those ineffable qualities of of you know going with a human now is is is going with a human editor going to be like you know owning your own horse in the future where it's just infinitely more expensive to to do something you know the hard way the old-fashioned way possibly but maybe not I don't know like I want to try and make tools for the editors too because I really like my editor right she's a brilliant woman and knows this art so thoroughly and is clearly passionate for it and there's probably still there's always going to be things that humans do differently and better than machines and vice versa even all the top players in every industry will say there are things that computers and machines in general are better at than humans and there are things that humans are better at and often kind of the way that it usually shakes out is it's like okay let's you know let's uh let's let the humans be good at the human things and the machines be good at the machine things and then we can work together to meet in the middle I don't know if it's gonna happen that way because it doesn't always right there are some things that machines just do better that you know like if you need to um uh like fly a drone into a volcano you don't need a human there period right you might need a human controlling the Drone um anyways I'm kind of going off on tangents but I did I did want to address this and say that like as as someone who is actively creating AI tools generative AI tools I have also made the decision not to dislocate any artists and editors and other creative types um and I you know I'm not even going to tell other people to to to follow my lead I'm making this choice because it it feels right for me um and and this backlash right now tells me that I did the right thing because I predicted months ago like I just created something that could hurt my friends and I actually feel really Vindicated that it's trending right now on Twitter is like you know no I'm not I don't want to hurt anybody um you know my my pursuit of you know of of fame or Glory or wealth or whatever it always takes a back seat to like hurting people that I care about or people people even people that I don't know that that like you know anyways I'm I'm repeating myself I'm rambling I think you get the point thanks for watching
