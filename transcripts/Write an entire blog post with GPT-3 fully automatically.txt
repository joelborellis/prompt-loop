[Music] foreign here for a video so today we are going to do auto Muse blogger so rather than generating long format fiction we're going to generate blog posts now before we get started before we get started um I have to warn you that one this use case if you were to try and just do this and put it directly online that is against open ai's policies so don't do this this is for research purposes only now that being said you are allowed as far as I know you are allowed to use AI to generate content as long as you then put human eyes on it to like edit it clean it up make sure that it's safe and then also I think part of the EULA requires that you say this was written by AI I think obviously check with uh check with open AI before going live on any apps that do this kind of thing but that being said um lots and lots of folks have wanted blogs and I've just had this turning in the back of my head so we will uh we will take a stab at this now also um I posted a poll on YouTube and the results were overwhelming y'all want to have um fewer videos but higher quality videos it was overwhelming so um stay tuned this is going to be my first one where I'll do some editing after the fact and uh and we'll go from there because I've also got the chapters right I figured out how to automatically do chapters with uh with gpt3 all right so all that out of the way let's get started first um when I when I'm starting a project like this um what I've started doing is kind of brainstorming getting my thoughts out because then I have a template to follow um oftentimes you see me rely on intuition and intuition is good and it works much of the time but not always and plus it's also not something that I can just tell you like use your intuition so let's actually do a process so what we're going to do is just brainstorm okay what it what do we think this is actually going to do so first we're going to say take a prompt of some sort natural and natural language instructions like I want to blog about X um brainstorm the structure of the request so um if you just ask instruct series to write it'll start writing I mean gpt3 generative pre-trained model is generative it will write but one thing that it doesn't do is it doesn't necessarily think about structure um and so given whatever the um the input is let's think about um the best way to do it uh So like um uh let's see like maybe list um a bunch of sections and then what we can do is we can probably iterate on that list to improve it um like is this a good list oops um okay so then once we have a list of sections um then we can say okay uh okay what after we have the sections then do we just start writing or do we do some research probably we'll do some research um uh let's see uh brainstorm um some interesting uh like some facts or points to include for each section yeah and then let's see and also we're gonna keep we're going to keep this in mind the whole time right so let's just bold that um okay so then we got some lists and points and then we actually want to write the thing um okay so then we'll write the actual sections um and then six uh iterate improve the sections and then done and I okay so that's where we'll start um I'm not going to dive into automatically pulling from external sources for this one for this we're going to start with something simple because gpt3 already knows a lot um but perhaps in a future version or a different kind of thing I might explore like an automatic Knowledge Graph Builder um because that's something I've wanted to do anyways but for for the for the sake of this one we're just going to assume that gpt3 already has the information built embedded in it somewhere because it's already read a lot of news and Reddit and Wikipedia and stuff so the topic that I was going to do um was going to be Shinto in Japan because I'm reading a book about Japanese history and culture so it's something that I happen to know a little bit about and of course like gpt3 has already read all of Wikipedia on all of these things so I'm going to assume that it has enough knowledge to do this so first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to the playground and we will say um so basically we're going to start with some prompt engineering I'll say um uh let's see um write a blog outline write a killer blog outline for the following request from a customer okay requests um I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and Corey gates in Japan like I'm basically adopting the percent of like a surfer bro like uh how did they come up with that idea what does it mean um and let's see and what are the coolest ones to see I'm going to Japan next summer because I'm a weeb sorry um I have a bunch of friends who are uh was it xenophile would be China what do you call it if someone is like an actual term if someone is obsessed with Japan they're into an anime and stuff I used to be in high school my my high school girlfriend got me into anime and I was into it for like 10 years and then I kind of like got over it I'm still a nerd I'm not trying to defend that okay write a killer blog uh outline for the following uh request from a customer all right so the request is this okay so now um brainstorm a list of sections for this blog post um each section uh let's see uh let's see the outline should meet the customers requests and each section should be let's say highly descriptive provide a paragraph explaining what should go should go into each section okay so then we'll do sections and we'll start with one so one thing that I do you'll notice uh often that I'll do all caps lock for for these things what that does it's very similar to what it does for humans so for humans it draws your eye to or you're like okay cool this is like a thing that I need to pay attention to but also it's a different set of tokens it's new it's represented differently inside of gpt3 which allows it to kind of notice oh this isn't just the word request this is capital r request okay so let's just let this run let's turn the token count up to a thousand and then it starts writing okay I don't want you to actually start writing it um so this isn't so good I want to actually give me like yeah not not just a table of contents but like describe each section so this is this is one thing that's really infuriating about um about the instructor series is that if you can tell if it was trained to do something like what you're asking it to do because it'll do it really well but if it wasn't it will just give you a table of contents and then start writing a thing um yeah actually I wonder if I confused it all right because like what is Shinto there we go how to inter incorporate tour Gates into your Japan trip that's not so bad okay so by I confused it when I said like add a paragraph because then it's like okay let's let's write out all these things and then yeah all right let's run this a couple times just to make sure that it's going to give me consistent Behavior the significance of tour Gates the different types of tour Gates the most famous story gates in Japan okay I think we're off to a good start so let's copy this as our first prompt um okay so we'll do request and then we'll do that so this we've got prompt um so this is going to be sections so let's see brainstorm the structure um take a list of bunch of sections iterate on that list to improve it is this a good list was I a good list you were the best list all right so what I mean by this is um lots of folks have started asking about like doing um like having gpt3 check itself to improve uh its own performance and I find that it can work really well not always um so let's just give let's take a stab at this let's copy this whole prompt out just for posterity's sake okay um I brainstormed the following list of blogs SEC of sections of a Blog um based on the customer's request um I need to uh uh um brainstorm to see if there's any there are any improvements they can make to this past uh uh I guess outline yeah that's the word I know words okay so then we'll do we'll copy the customer request and then we'll do outline and let's come back over here copy that all right and so then we'll do uh brainstorm let's see no brainstorm some possible improvements all right let's see what it does dad doesn't get it well maybe it added a list it added an item how to visit Tory Gates oh okay [Music] let's run that again see if it gives us what is Shinto okay tips for seeing tour Gates so it did add a section [Music] all right hmm I wonder what happens if we do this again okay what happens if we just regurgitate this Shinto festivals associated with tour Gates look at that okay so if we run this so this I'm at the point in my career with gpt3 where like if my intuition generates a prompt that behaves correctly the first time I don't trust it because I'm like wait a second hmm is this an accident so then we'll say outline um but basically prompt um improve outline and we'll change the sections to outline because for whatever reason my brain did not helpfully supply the word outline because that's where you start when you're writing anything start an outline um uh yeah okay so then we'll take I keep leaning over because my camera my microphone's a little bit in the way so if the audio is a little bit worse I apologize but I want to not be leaning over the whole video okay let's just keep recycling this to see um see if it keeps improving frequently asked questions I wonder if it's just gonna keep adding sections because this is actually doing a good job of like what can we do to add to this so probably if if it keeps going indefinitely okay so now what we have done is is it has converged so what we can do is we'll just keep rerunning this um until until we get convergence which means that the input is the same as the output um okay so yep so that's good and what am I doing all right so improve outline and let's see keep it an editor no because I named it wrong so we've got the outline and then we've got improve outline and that's good okay yes I wonder will it break if I if I give it a number one that might prompt it to ensure that it will oh additional resources okay so one thing that you can do is you can kind of give it a clue as to what you want want it to look like and so that's what you do here where I have this this is just it's a clue it says give me a numbered list right I don't have to tell it to give me a numbered list I just give it a little tiny breadcrumb to say give me a numbered list um so I might do the same here just so that way because sometimes you might end up with something where it's like hey I'm going to come up with a completely new idea um but if you tell it what you want implicitly or explicitly so this is an implicit request of the machine so this might this might break it we'll have to after we run it we might um we might have to come back to this um okay let's go here okay request all right and then I think it's time to start coding actually um because what I like to do is before I get too far um actually no well hmm let me take a look at uh at the readme how far do we want to go okay so we got the iteration so we're already halfway done brainstorm some facts or points to include for each section okay so let's try this then let's try our hand at yada yada yada I wish I hadn't closed those other ones okay so given ah let's see I have the following uh blog request to write um I am focusing on um writing one second at a time um or uh let's see I need to brainstorm uh no I need to jot down some notes about each section before I proceed now each section this section um this section before I proceed okay um section so then we'll just say what is Shinto and then we'll say um let's see here are my research notes on this section I need to write everything I know about this and let's see what it does okay here are my let's say let's let's see what happens we say detailed research notes there we go much better the yep you say Grand shrine god of the sun goddessama thratsu okay this is all in line with what I'm reading in my book so it looks like it is um this is actually one that I'm not sure I haven't read about that in the book but anyways so it does look like it's being accurate um although I wish this was a little bit more I do I like the the that it it seemed like it produced a little bit more when it was a list so what let's see if we give it a clue um yeah Shinto is the largest with over 100 million follow your followers located in the city ize um first and then if we do this again um see but this isn't everything that you know right like I said I asked for detailed research notes I need to write everything I know and it gives me six bullet points really really um okay that's fine but one thing that's interesting is it seems like into means the way of the Gods it almost seems like I can just run it a few times and it will give me different outputs each time so maybe for this section we just run it a couple times actually this seems like it's working okay yeah okay all right so probably what we'll do is just break the sections down and then we will um we'll run this where we're asking for notes on each section we'll run it a couple times um to kind of get a little bit more out of it out of the machine um that seems like it's working okay-ish um okay so then we'll do request and then we'll do um section [Music] and then we'll just leave this open-ended so it might produce a paragraph it might produce a list okay so we'll do prompt research um actually here we'll do section research and so what this is doing just to take a step back and tell you like okay what is what is this actually doing so one misconception that people have is whether or not gpt3 is pulling from a database or searching the internet or what how is it how is it doing all this and so all this information is embedded in the neural network and so what we're doing is we're writing a prompt to pull that information out of the neural network and so the this works in a similar fashion to how human brains work and that our all of our knowledge and memories is implicit in the array of Connections in our brain and so with the right input or the right and sometimes the input can come from inside of our own brains like if you're sitting there thinking like I need to think about everything I know about Japan you can kind of you know trace the dots you can connect the dots and get you know kind of pull out memories from your own brain and we're doing the same thing here we're we're breaking apart that that cognitive process of okay let me think through about everything that I know about this um and so that's what we're doing deliberately um okay so we got this section um brainstorm some facts or things to include uh let's see you'll just repeat repeat this like two or three x times um and so then what then what we'll do is this is actually working better than I thought okay so we'll say we'll copy out some of this information and run it a couple times [Music] estimated 4 million followers see that's something where it's like 100 million and now there's four million like okay so we don't know if it's accurate but this could also be a benefit of running running it a few times yeah oops what just happened [Music] how did I do that current editor there we go okay so that's three iterations let's go for four because it seems like if you get four or first codified in the 8th Century CE according to the book I'm reading that is not true Japan didn't have written language until after the fourth Century a d c e so it couldn't have been codified and it's saying 4 million again so we will do fact checking in another video okay um all right I have compiled research notes um I have compiled the following research notes I need to rewrite these notes into um into a long professional blog post it must be engaging and interesting and so then we'll do research and then we'll do um [Music] engaging blog post and so basically all I'm going to do is take each of those sections do some research some internal brainstorming research and then we'll we'll generate a post on each of those sections [Music] now one thing is that will be that it that it will tend to do is it'll have these like little like sign offs right and it's like okay I don't want I don't want that but but we might have to deal with that okay anyways we'll probably can probably fix that at the end actually so let's go ahead and just copy this out okay um so do research and then engaging blog post and so this will be prompt um this will be uh section Pros so we're actually producing a final product at this point um yeah I think I think we're almost done because then we got the actual sections iterate and improve ah okay so yeah I like that um so if we if we take this we might need a second um okay yeah yeah this will actually work out well um I think I've got it all saved here yeah okay so then we'll just copy this here I wonder what will happen if I just say like let's see I've compiled I need to rewrite the notes into a long professional blog post it must be engaging I have the first draft of the post now I need to um improve on it okay so then we'll say um first draft oh hang on my dog's barking I gotta go see what he's barking at okay sorry about that um all right yes so first draft and then we'll just add some new lines and do second draft and you see like this this is getting long but one we've broken it down into sections um so we don't have to write the whole blog post at once and you see it's only a thousand tokens um so we're only at a quarter of our of our maximum um okay look at this Shinto believes in practices were first brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants I don't know that that's accurate but we see that this has this has gotten a little bit better um it's definitely integrating a little bit more of the information whether or not this information is factually accurate is different so in a future version I'll probably what I'll do is show you how to integrate from a corpus of facts of of of like other information rather than just relying on confabulation and neural recall so this when you ask when you ask gpt3 to just barf out a bunch of facts that's called neural recall and it can be pretty accurate um but it can also be crazy wrong um Okay so let's see what happens if we just do this iteration a couple more times so it's just [Music] whoops oh and it's just jumping down okay foreign it's actually making it shorter oh no clarified it a little bit okay okay so this this seems like it works okay so let's add this as a um so we'll do section second draft and then we'll do this as research add a double new line there just to make it nice and consistent and then we'll prompt um uh excuse me Pros um I actually do prompt improve Pros and then we'll just Stitch it all together and that's all programmatic um okay fault temperature to 7 The Tokens to one thousand because that's what we want all right uh let's see yeah um well first we need the uh the topic okay so topic equals open file and we'll do topic.txt so I will save that here so save topic dot text [Music] all right so we get the topic and then the first thing we do is outline it and then we improve the outline okay I've got too many tabs open let me close some of these ah no don't close that one cancel cancel [Music] abort okay and then we'll say um let's see outline equals change [Music] um yeah here I'll just do this the messy way I can work on cleaning it up and making it more efficient later I have coffee and I'm not drinking it what the heck is wrong with me [Music] epic um okay so now we're gonna do build the outline prompt equals open file so this was see this is why I need to keep at least the prompts open all right so prompt outline and then it'll be prompt improve outline and then section research which will just run a few times prompt improve Pros um okay and then Pros okay cool so the outline we only run once so do prompt outline dot text and then we'll do dot replace um topic or no I guess it was request yeah so just to keep things consistent we'll do request because the worst thing you can do for yourself is use use multiple names for the same variable it's very confusing I do not recommend that yeah all right sorry I'm having to lean away from from my microphone again and it's making it's throwing off my whole keyboard situation as someone who writes it's like there's this flow connection um and you can't hear it because I've got the uh the like noise cancellation but I use a mechanical keyboard so you're welcome for that for you seeing the thing I use Nvidia broadcast which is really helpful um okay so we're replacing it request with the request that should be good um and then we'll do um outline equals we'll do one um plus and we're going to remove that and then we'll do plus um gpt3 completion prompt okay and then for debug we'll just print the outline and we'll run this to make sure that it works um python generate whoops CD Auto Muse blogger python generate [Music] request.txt right because I changed the file name in here but it didn't read my mind and change the file name out here okay try that again okay cool so that worked that looks good um all right so then what did I do I did um see this is this is why you write down what your plan is open the readme back up um okay so we got that iterate on the list that's right we did this about four times um okay so then we'll say um for I and list range zero four we are going to do outline equals improve outline and then we'll pass it the request and the outline and so basically this is this is the easiest way to do a recursive thing so we'll do def improve outline and we're going to have the request and the outline passed in and so then we're just going to use this prompt um so we say prompt equals open file prompt improve outline dot text and so what you're seeing here this is this is the um the most basic form of recursive programming with gpt3 where you feed the same the output into the same function several times um so dot replace request with request and then dot replace [Music] um outline with outline make sure that I use the right terminology yes outline is there brainstorm some possible improvements okay and then we'll copy the same outline one dot and so the reason that you have to include this is because the prompt already has that see if you don't have that then the first one will not have its numbered list and that just it just it's bad form and it doesn't look good and then we'll do return outline okay so then we will um here we'll actually for debug purposes I'll just leave all this to do new line new line outline and then we'll do improved outline okay now let's test this real quick what is Shinto tips for visiting facts okay so it is it is reliably recreating what we wanted and then it converged uh and then it blew it up curse you okay yeah it didn't it it just it randomly nuked it okay let's have fewer iterations because if you do if you if you if you try your luck it will eventually Break um the coolest Tory gates in Japan different types of Contour Gates okay so doing One initial iteration and then three iterations seems to be good all right so we'll leave it at that um cool so actually it can be kind of fun to leave the uh the debug output so I'll probably just leave that there so that when you're running it you can see what it's doing okay now we consult the scriptures we got the good list brainstorm some facts or points for each one yes okay so then section research yes okay so sections equal outline dot split lines so now the sections list we can iterate on this um a few times but we're actually zeroing in on the final product so let me think of how to do this because do we want to write it one section at a time I think we do yeah because the way that the way that it breaks down now is we do the research on the section we do the pros on the section and then we stitch it all together we improve the pros and then we have the final product okay so we'll do final blog equals so we'll do that okay so four section in sections so we're gonna just we're gonna take each section and just write the whole thing we might have a final step where we kind of like clean up the whole blog um actually that's not a bad idea let me go ahead and add that note so I don't forget um iterate through the sections and done lies um uh let's see clean up the final product yes okay so four section in sections uh first is hashtag research sorry I need to drink this coffee #research okay um yes so we'll say research equals uh that and then uh let's see how many times did we do this I think we did it like three or four times so we'll do we'll do the same thing that we did here so for I in list range we'll say um uh uh result equals um research topic actually no here we'll call it neural recall because that's a more accurate thing as to what we're doing so the neural recall is yeah so we need to pass the request in the section requests section and there will be some redundancy but that's fine that's why we added the seventh step to clean up the final product to just let's rewrite the whole thing to be one nice consistent blog post [Music] um okay so result equals neural recall deaf neural recall this is like this is the nerdier version of Total Recall uh request extra points if uh I guess they made a remake of that um but the original Total recalled with Arnold Schwarzenegger came out when I was uh much younger I was alive when it came out some of my viewers are older than me many of them are younger so if you raise your hand uh give me a thumbs up or or a comment in the section in the in the comments below if you remember the original Total Recall okay neural recall what is it that we're doing this is basically just another prompt prompt equals open file uh prompt section research dot text and then we do that replace uh yes what were the sections that I had in here request and section right these two see that is where you do yourself a favor if you have variables that are very simple and straightforward and make sense and then Place uh section with Section okay and then we do uh let's see um notes equal gpt3 completion prompt um and then return notes and I know what some of you are thinking you're thinking oh you can just do return this um there's nothing wrong with that but I got out of the habit of doing that because every now and then you'll want to do some little like post-processing like notes equals notes dot replace you know that with that you know depending on uh the kind of format you're looking for um so I just got out of the habit of of returning the function result directly um and and capturing the results in a variable and then passing the variable back it's either or you can do whatever you want um it saves you a line of code um but you know okay a line of code who cares um to me it's not really worth saving okay so then research equals research plus um let's see that's going to have no new line so we'll do plus new line dollar s and then we'll do dollar result um yes okay so the research will be done so research equals research dot strip which that will remove any Superfluous white space from the ends so now we've got the research yes so we'll run the research a couple times we've done the research and then we take the research and write the blog post okay so do first draft not draft five um okay this should be as straightforward as prompt equals prompt section no what am I doing good grief open file prompt sectionpros dot text and do replace research with research so this is there's a couple things happening here so there's prompt chaining which is where you've got prompt prompt prompt prompt prompt so that's prompt chaining but then we're also doing iterative Loops so we're doing recursive Loops inside of the prompt chain um so this is this is pretty Advanced but this is this is just the same process that a human goes through when writing when writing a thing you you brainstorm the structure you gather all the facts then you write the pros and then you iterate on the pros and make it better um now I need to improve on it I wonder if it would be good if we gave it some descriptions like we need to make it more engaging um but whatever okay [Music] prompt open file okay and so then we'll say Pros equals bd3 completion um prompt there you have it all right so that's our first edition of the pros and then we do the same thing here where we attach the research and the pros this should actually probably we'll change this to Pros keep it nice and consistent and I think we did it what like two or three times before it started kind of going off the rails so we'll do we'll do just two improvements of improving the pros um okay so Pros equals um uh improve Pros and so what did I have in here we have the research on the pros research and prose um so we just improve itself so recursive programming for for kitties who don't know you could not do this where you pass a variable where you you assign a variable and pass it at the same time this is a newer thing back in the days of Pascal and C plus plus you have what you would have to do uh you'd have to declare something like prose 2 equals pros and then you'd say Pros equals Pros too is silly but now you don't have to do that anymore now you can just call it directly and it's just a single step um okay so the improved Pros is going to be the same as improve outline with mild difference so we'll do improve pros and instead of request and outline its research and prose so we'll do um improve Pros research oops uppercase and Pros oh whoops I'm going to replace both lowercase and then Pros uppercase and then we don't need that and so then we also change the name back to prose and prose okay so then we call improved Pros we just call it a handful of times and we end up with a better set of pros and actually what we'll do is we'll declare the final blog as a list and so then we'll do um final blog dot append um Pros so that'll be a list of sections that we can then we can keep them separate so that we can give them headers and also we can continue to improve them separately if we want are we done hold on this is what happens to me I get so focused on what I'm doing that it's just like wait that's the end right I know there is one last thing but I want to see how this looks before we do the final step which is this one clean up the final product okay so let's give some whoops let's come back here let's get some output as we go so we'll print [Music] new line new line research um [Music] yeah so we'll do first we'll print new line new line section section use that variable right yep so then we do the section and then we do research because we need to we need something to look at while we're you know doing this um and I'll do print uh new line new line Pros and then we'll just copy this down here and then it'll be appended and so then finally here at the end of all things we will just do um here we'll do from P print import s so this is pretty print so we'll do pretty print final blog and this is just for debug okay so let's I need to zoom out a little bit because this is enormous well now let's see let's see how it looks okay generate a Blog end to end history of Shinto [Music] improved outline predictions for the future of the religion that's cool heck yeah oh wow that got real long so we're gonna have 10 sections we'll probably like accelerate this oops it crashed research is not defined what do you mean I did a typo let's see this is line 87. right here dang so close but this is why you test your code all right let's do this again all right I am going to make it a little smaller because this is outputting quite a bit so we'll do we'll go down to 24. there how to build a toy gate there we go oh we've got and we've got the double new lines so for the out for the final outline um outline equals outline dot replace and we'll do double new line with just single new line because we're going to end up with yeah okay but this is this is this is all right so far so good foreign and then the section has nothing yeah darn it darn it and it puts out nothing we'll just let it finish and see what happens there are about 80 000 Shinto shrines there's all of our research so that's good [Music] welcome to my blog about Shinto Okay cool so this is going to iterate through each of these sections for a little while I think I'm gonna go ahead and pause the video and uh we'll see because you get you get the idea we don't need to read this so we'll pause the video we'll come back once it's done it worked mostly um It produced a lot of content I'll put it that way um now unfortunately this was just a test run so we've got all this so let's just just get all this out to a text file and um so I I added this while we were waiting where it'll actually save it out to file because I should have done that and I'll probably separate out so that we'll clean up the blog afterwards but first let's just see what we've got so let's do a refined and replace the single quotes with nothing place all and then we'll replace um backslash backslash n with nothing actually no this will be normal finder place so that cleans that up yeah there we go um okay that is yeah there's a lot I'm not going to read the whole thing but we've got it's 21 000 characters long um so clearly this is like yeah this this this is quite a bit um I think what I'm gonna do uh because that's that's well how many tokens is this let's plug this into 50 5 000 tokens so we want it to be maybe half that maybe not quite as long so what we'll do is we'll do um just a little bit less research and a little bit less a little bit less brainstorming um so hopefully that will make it a little bit more reasonable because what I'd like to be able to do is to do the final Cleanup in one window um and we can't do that right now um Okay so we've got this I've got it so it'll save it out to file I wish that I had done this the first time but what we're going to do is we're going to choose an entirely different topic because I tested it on one topic um so I want a blog post about the history of the printing press I'd like to know how it influenced religion politics and War throughout history and up through the Modern Age um okay so I'm gonna go ahead and kick this off generate blog and then we'll come back with a brand new blog and then we will get into um we'll get into the um the process of improving a Blog automatically um why is it doing nothing did it not do any research oh there it is okay there we go um okay so I'm gonna go ahead and pause it and we'll come back in just a second okay we have a blog post about the printing press um and I think I actually lied I think I'm gonna call it here because this is actually not bad um and it doing improving an existing document is worth its own project so I think what's going to come after this is I'll have one video or a project about pulling from external sources like how to search and automatically compile sources because that has applications all over the place such as automated research for like Academia not just writing blogs and then automatically improving stuff at basically being an editor is a whole other function so we will call this a day get status get add git commit am all done and get push so uh yeah so there's a blog post out here it is now 10 000 characters long which means that it should fit into a single um yeah window so you could in theory ask gpt3 hey take this blog post and rewrite it if you want to I'm not going to worry about it um because yeah this video is already plenty long and you have you now have an end to end process of prompt chaining and recursive prompting um in order to generate you know be very generative and make something better remember use this responsibly I am not responsible if you uh use this to do something unethical um yeah this is on you uh anyways thanks for watching uh like And subscribe and consider supporting me
