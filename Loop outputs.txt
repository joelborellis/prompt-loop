new hypothesis: The deepest part of the ocean is known as the Challenger Deep, located at the southern end of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. This is the deepest known seabed point on Earth, with a depth of approximately 10,920 meters, although measurements can vary slightly due to the challenges of conducting research at such extreme depths.

The Challenger Deep has been visited by a number of deep-submergence vehicles (DSVs), including the Limiting Factor, which holds records for the deepest crewed dives in all five oceans. This DSV, operated by Gabe Newell's Inkfish organization, was the first crewed submersible to reach the deepest point in all five oceans, and over 21 people have visited the Challenger Deep in this vehicle.

The conditions at the bottom of the ocean are extremely harsh, with cold temperatures, high pressure, and complete darkness. Despite these conditions, life can still be found here, although it is much less diverse than in the photic zone, which is the uppermost layer of the ocean where sunlight can penetrate and photosynthesis can occur. The deep ocean is part of the aphotic zone, where no light penetrates, and it is characterized by a lack of photosynthetic organisms.

The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate, acting as a heat reservoir and influencing weather patterns. It is also a major habitat for a wide variety of species, although the deep ocean is less biodiverse than the shallower regions. The ocean is under threat from a variety of human activities, including pollution, overfishing, and the effects of climate change, such as warming, acidification, and sea level rise.
